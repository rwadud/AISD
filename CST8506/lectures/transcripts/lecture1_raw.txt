So the the the metrolology, what's the metrolology means? Crisp, you? C. And I will not go through every chat again. It's not not quiet, I feel. But these are the cases that you should follow for any missilani project. Early exception is like if you're working with images, you do not need to understand. There is no understanding face of marish, much preparation face. Only scaling is required for. What is the input for the images? So if you have 10,000 in, what is the nature of inputs, or what are those values? M sense, right. Those values are pixels. We do not need to work and code. You do not need to scare like creating new columns, constructing new column. These things are not required for that. But otherwise, for a missionary project, we need to understand the business, understand the data, prefer it, creating models, finding the answers from the models to make sure that it's working for. It's working fine. And then after the evuation phase, you can deploy it in the science spite. This phase is safe for any missionary project in general, okay? And your initially we talked about these two parts already, supervised learning and supervised learning. Last term, we learned for the classification, the launch different classification techniques, yeah. Then reggression we talk about this up approaches, our supervised learning, pluseringly large gings. Our players, a lawyer and IS. Yeah? Then for the prep-processing, in general, how what are the different preprocesses tests made itistally the data, that means that there is missing data, we should handle it. There is a duplicates, we have to handle it, we have to understand whether they are actual duplicates or not. Okay. So I think last time or so, even after all the discussions, sometimes in the project they mentioned that they have a 30% of behaves. Why you are getting 30% duplicates an endorm website data? Did you guys think about it? If you are getting percentage of your crash data, let's of a little crashes. maximum data. that Do you think every officers are simply entering data? Why you are getting percentage implicates? or what is the possibility of getting like what mistake your way? Yeah. Maybe removing viral or unique information. It just dumbles up everything together. So by the Mars you remove a lot of calls and keeping only like, you had like 80 calls and you have to come down to you're narrowing down to 20 coll or 15 coll. And then if you over, you'll see my many of them arelicates. They are not actually duplicates. It's very less chance that you can duplicate that you can have duplicates in governmentment class size. You can have maybe one or two, maybe two officers entered one case, two back then. Two officers entered the same case Then we have twice, plus day. But normally there will be much to duplicates. Okay? Or if some sensor is 40 and if just says some information with the same day time up to millisecond or microseconds, it is 40, you can get sub 50 something like that. Otherwise there is less chance to have goodication in your day. So these are all dedly staps and we can indicate data from multiple sources, which we talked about last time. Then we can transform data, right. Yeah. So I' a transformation we talking about these terminologies. There' remember. What is normalization? What is normalization? It follow between normal. You are Rhys Kaling, your values, so that your values are every value between zero and one, okay? That is normalization. And you can nage normalization, which means you are resaling it all these of res scale. You have a scale, but you are res scaling it. So that means a rac normalization assume that I want to put everything between one and 10. So my range is 1 to 10 I'm just a resaling those values, so that every value is between one 100.0. In that case, my minus 1 max is 10. There is the organization. What is searization? What do you mean? around the Greenation is what. So it will be centred around the origin, okay? That is stamariization. And then we talked about binning, right? Yeah. So if you have a follow, you can bin it in different ways. You have acar bini, you can have equal with the binning, you can have equal frequency. equal b the binning means, you can specify the b of the base. So everyone from age 0 to 10 in mid 1., 10 to 20 in mid 2. you' specificifying the width of the bits. or you can specifying frequency, how many it will be in each bit, you can tell. Okay, first 20 instances in mid one, next 20 in bidu. In that case, it must be sorted. Okay. Now is a bidding we talk about last term. And then we talk about family. We talked about top family, R standing and str fight families. Okay, what is stratified soundling? Spatified, or give an example of stratifiedling. Any example? she took from the Dallas? Not a str toified example. like a group ofas and then you select a group from each strata. So one each and then you can do like you bit age and then you select. So if you mid age, then if you have a if you have a structure based of age, for example, child, you adult senior elder, okay? And you are taking this many percentage of instances from every group that is 25 or other for example is many women Many female can.. So every month is a strata, like Monday is decision maker. So you are getting like like some percentage from every month. Those instances happened in January. So 10,000 are from Jack, 10,000zen from a film. You can set the number of instances, on the course of instances from every month. That is, try to find yourself. Okay? Yeah? And that's true? So these all things we learn last. So I expect you know these days, okay? If if you do not know that one ref knowledge level the last year and make sure that you have a good understanding about these prep processing techniics. So today we are going to work about dionality reduction, okay? So density renection, why this is this is an important topic? Sometimes we may have more features. or 1 million features. Okay. So you can manage hundred features, but if we have 1 million features or 100,000 features, it is not easy to manage. Okay. So we want to attend in any, we want to reduce the dimensions for different races. If you have, so just take the example of Eupid distance. You have two instances. This is a simple example. So if you have two instances and these two instances, and you have a 10,000 features. So there are four. 2, F, 10,000. Okay? And you have two features, doing stresses inance one, and instance two. What will be how will, like, you' looks like? So what about, like, how many what is two distance? Eucliden distancestems, the formula? Square... So, how manyants will be there inside? 10,000? You will have 10,000 covenants inside, right? Yeah, because you have 10,000 features. Agree? So, if we have only thousand creatures, you'll have a thousand dollars here. So it's good. So the compressative will increase if you increase if you have a large number of large number of features. Yeah. So you want to reduce the number of features always, but without losing a lot of information. So if you from 10,000 from 10,000, if I come down to 10, I may lose a lot of information. Okay? So I can tell how much of information I want. I want to keep. So maybe I can specify 90% of information I want to. Or 80% of information I want to get, and keeping thatge in mind, if I can reduce this number of features, then I can reduce the complexity of my models. Agree? Yeah, that is the is the basic understanding of the plain blackish meaning of red, reduced the number of features. Why retaining essential information, and we are solving the problem in blood dimensions. The drawbacks that are tcing, high American consumption, complex models. You can understand, we get on create, like, or leave with the the maximum is three dimensions, that we can missualize. Right? If we have four dimensions, there is no way that we can visualize. Those four dimensions, the mass of myst three dimensions we can visualize. So these are all the drawback. And are the problem, the cur of the main problem is if we have 10,000 features, this is in that 10,000 emotional space. Every point. So when you have two dimensions, we can draw it like this, right? So if you if you have only two dimensions.. I get a drawer like this, okay? So this is my excit. This is my way access, my board to be something like this, okay? If I have three dimensions, I have one more dimension, and then still I can prod it. If I have 10,000 dimensions, in theory, there is a tender 10,000 dimensional space. E instance is a point in the 10,000 dimensional space. Agree? Yeah. When we haveions, every point will be standing surprising. Okay? When you have a large number of dimensctions, every point will be scattered and very hard to find matters in it. Okay? That is a Basically, that this is very source of losing is mate, we are not getting any meaning for decisions from those dist value. And still, if we want to make some sense, you should have a lot of data, because you have to them some 10,000 dimensions. You have a lot of data to make some patterns in that balary number of dimensional space. Okay? So it's good to come down. if you have less number of dimensions by this better, but withouting a lot of it information. So we have two options. One news features selection, for a st extraction. Feature selection read it last. So we are selecting, we are ignoring redundant once. We are ignoring 11 ones. We are selecting the ones that we want to keep or have some meaning for that question we are trying to answer. That is feature selection. In this class, we are talking about feature extraction. Okay. Feature extraction means we are basically creating sympletic features. I'll show how to look it. we are meaning out of it and creating synthetic features using, for example, I instead of having these two axes, I'm going to create one axis that can represent this point meaningful. That is basically feature X clash. So how to do it on a show. features that are very interesting features. How can we do that? We have two techniques, one principal analysis, one as linear discipal analysis. So we take principal analysis first. So I'll go with an example first. So the how point is like. These are my points, Okay? Yeah? So how to So the objective is we have two axis, maybe this is like. And this is whipped off, maybe some assume that you' human acet and this is the length I picked up a tune. Okay? So instead of keeping this length ended, how can I reduce it to one factor? Now we have two factors, right? Two features length that way. How can I reduce these two features into one feature? There is no name for that feature, but can I find an axis? Can I find a new axis that I can represent these points meaningfully in one dimension? Okay? That is the question. Can I find a new axis? What's the purpose of that axis? Inst of using this length and width, can I have some synthetic axis that represents these points mainly? W that is the purpose. So, if I have these points, I can, so I can have, like, passing cl the, I can throw different lives like this, right? It's are all different aes, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I take one axis, so how are we able to do this like this? So to take one of the lights and show how we can do this. So Iume that this is my is my choice, okay? So how how to find this linus, I will be projecting these poems onto this line. Okay? So all these lines are projected on this new line, okay? And so I can have many lines, right? To any of these lines, I can protect these points. Yeah, agree? Yeah. To any of these lines, I can protect these points. But which line I can which line I should select, which lines gives me the maximum weight. maximum variance means. So this point is projected here. So there is a distance from here to the origin. This point is projected here. There is a distance from here to the origin. This point is projected here. There's a distance from here to here. This is here, so there's a distance is here. This is here. There's here. So all these distances, some of all these distances should be maximum. Understood? So if I have. So. So these take the first point. First point is projector here, right?. So first a point is projected here. There is a distance from these projected projected position to the origin. Agree? Yeah. So this is d1. Then I have the next poem projected here. This distancy is d2. Then I have this poem projected here, which is distance b 3.. Okay? Yeah. So likewise, I know how many points. One, two, three, four, five, six. So I have six distances, they want to be six. Okay. They want, two, I have six distances, Game one to d six. Okay. So if this distances some of distances is the biggest means, these protific points are spreaded on that new line. Okay? Yeah? If the distance is small, so I have two lines, line one and line two. Line one, some of the distance, some of distances, and line two, some of distances. If this is 2.8 and this is 5.6, what is the meaning of it? We' L1 and L2. What is the meaning of these two lines? Which line has points spreaded more. Second. L2, right? L2 line has points spreaded more as compared to L1, Okay? So we can create infinct number of ones. Okay? But the objective is to find the line, find the line that maximizes the distance. Okay, that's true. So if it is spread up on the light, that is the maximum variance. Okay, we are trying to see how much variance that line is giving us. Nes? Yeah? That is the logic you offer. So once you find a line like this, this So after that, we don't have, once we have this line created with the maximum variance, then this is our new points. Our new points are or this new asss. Underst. Every wants me to repeat. So, when you're finding the projection, I have to, so, how do you find the projections first, the point on the line? Do you, do you try to get that X component and the white component? That is the math is different. But the logic. Logic wise got the logic. I can one more time if you want. Okay. Because very, if you check textbooks, you will see some math formula and that's it. don't understand what's happening in I see. So, I need to have some p... Okay, so let's start one more time. So, I have.. I, a few points. So this is the axis length. This is the axis sp.. So, assume that the other same thing. So, in theory, we have a stz the otherwise, if one axis is age and the other this is s, it's not meaningful, right? So we have to stanize the data for sure. But I' feeling that part that I expl I assume that they're already already in the in the car scheme on the same sche. So I'm going to put the points. So we have points. Okay, enough fine points. So. I getro insite number of lines passing through the origin, in this space. But you guys are, right? I can draw in a number of flanks. But my objective is to fight deadline that satisfies some condition. Okay? I want to the condition is, I want to find a line such that once these points are projected onto that line, that you should be spreaded the maximum. Okay? Those poise should be spreaded on that line, and whichable les line gives the maximum spread, that is the best line. Oh, that is that is the gives access v are going to consider. Understand so far, yeah? So we want to find one axis and the condition for that axis is once I project points on to large new axis, my new points for the points or that axis should be sped to the maximum. So I can have. So once it is I can have voice, I ask you that there is one line like this, okay? On this one, n, the points are like this. And at the line or at the line, maybe something like this. This line is giving me point spreaded like this. Okay, this is one line and this is the other line. Which line use the maximum spread. This is line one, and this is line two. Line two? Line two, use the maximum spread. Right? So I can create infinite number of lines, but whichever lines use the maximum spread for the projected points, that is the new axis. Understood. The spread is like the sum of all the distances. All the distances. Okay. So I'm going to put So I can have infinite number of minds. So this can be one line. This can be underlined. This can be. This can be a line so I draw three lines. L1, L2, I' L3. I can't project like theoreically, I can project these points to any of these lines, right? Yeah. So in the first line, maybe this is giving me a point here, here, here, here and here. But for this one, this may be giving something like this. Okay. So each of our minds gives the maximums, maximum variance. That is the axis I want to find. Yeah. So when I have this optimal line, maybe something like this. So this point is a projected here, like this is projected here like this. This is projected like here. This is projected here. This is projected here. Okay. Makes sense. All good? Yeah? Okay. No, I show something. Um, let's. So then is this admnition here. here. You start making bigger. See? All these flines that they are showing up varied lights. Okay? Yeah. For everything, every line the points are projected. But the objective is to find the line that maximizes the distance. is descendant. Okay. Oh, okay. So this is a scr from minus 3 to plus three? Yeah. Understood? Yeah, yeah. I thought the line had to start from 00 from the origin. Yeah. here. Oh, oh. Alibi stick not make a like this, so that's why they look like that. Okay? Understood? Yeah. So in this case, the line that is going through this purple parallel to this purple segments is that bus line that maximize circumstances. Okay. Understood. Yeah. This is the basic lotic of principal common analysis, but you will not see this type of expressionary textbook. The textbook, you will see A, again back up and transform the values. These people to understand what's happening behind the scene.? This page gives you a very good explanation on this is given in your slide. M I put a trying to create something. I don't want to just put it as myself. So I put the same pat here. They sugar in the cur right. They worked on this to create a simulation. So they should get the courage. So I put that here. It's the first way is the one that I showed now. So I'm giving a very good explanation on what's happening also in the subage, okay? So when it get some time, read this page to get some of that's more bit more parody on this. Okay? But now we talk about the logic. But how to do it mathematically. That is what you is normally see in the textbook, just to some calculations from D and medicine and inventors, but no idea what is happening behind the scene. So, that is the next spot... It's okay, so basically, I identify the direction, and now, if you do this, it makes more sense. I identify the directions in which the data varies the most, that means the most to varivious. Okay. Whichever direction gives gives the most variance for the data. That is the purpose. So for that problem, I' going to new centre for ais align with thesections, so the personal various. I will show mathematically how to do this. These of us just the other follow. First is sumrise that we all know why we have the sunrise. Why? Otherwise, if there is the are in two different sc, it doesn't make any sense. So we have to make sure that the various starts standardized. And we want to find the leaderships between attributes thats why we have to calculate the communist mattress, because we want to get these projections, right? At the end of the day, we' going to get these projections and the distances for like whichever gives the maximum value that is what we want to find. But how to find using linal algebra concept? This is mostly lal algebra, the math of it by finding hagen values and inventors. So all about is sunrise. So we know the correlation, like if it is one, what is the it is positive, what is the meaning of it? Positive correlction, it's. It is increasing or decreasing together. two att both are increasing height and weight together. Okay. There are some magic that one increases otherreases that is negative. Okay? So increases two or diffreases together, that is fitive formation, and like one increases other decrease, that is negative. So if you have to find a cus, so how to find this line or this direction and the effect of it is you see lenient alra concepts, which is agen vectors and agen bands. Okay? So we are not going to the proof of it, but the objective is to find, we want to find a direction, such that, when these pol are projected onto it, the variants will be the maximum, okay? That is the purpose result. Oh, sorry. One question about step two, if you find that they are correlated, we shouldn't No, no, no. We are not doing such structctions at default. At this point, so we have we have some assumptions, like they are they are not the middle of each other, but in reality, most of them have some correlations. Okay. But we'll keep this that correlations will be reflected in the final calculation. Once you get this new anxis, there will be uncorrelated. So, So we have to the map of this. I have an extraal sheet so that we can work on this. You might not be interested that. guys like to work on this? This is the mad step by step, like, how to do this, like, I took this set of values and stization I want to know the average, the min and theation, applying gas, s apply mat, then valus calculation val specta calculation and finally, because a new points of the new axes. So we have to do the mark of which, okay? But before going in the math of it, we will talk about LDA also, and then once we finish the four discussions for today, we can start the map of this. Otherwise, if I go up with the map now, you are no made rain quickly. I understand what's happening with LDA. Sounds good? Yeah? So when you do the math of this, I can get more clarity what's happening. But what is a draw on this picture. This is two axis into one axis I showed, but in real life, we may have 10,000 axes. 10,000 demips means we have 10,000 axes. We are coming down to maybe 10, so we have to need to know how many how many axes we want to keep. Okay, that is the next thing. So the new we just created us cleanar combinations of initial features. So one example, yesterday I found one example I thought is that example. Yeah. So your, we have a high time weight on Xitus and YS. So on X to see how height, how height. And yxis beh how weight. Okay. So we are reducing this high tech weight. We do one axe. We don't have height information and great information, separately, once we reduce it to one image. Okay? Then one dimension may be the new new axis maybe something like sites. Light, we can out. Specally tell what is what is the name. But basically, if it is height and name, we can tell. The new art may be represent the sight of the person. Okay? Just as an example. But in theory, Mor name this new ais as something. So this is length and this is bit. They call this as principal convenant one. Okay? So if you have react, so in the case of I dozen, how many attribors see how? Four. four attributes, right? So in the case of Iris, K. You know, four attues. So if you have four attributes, you get fined. If theory, you can find four comants. Four principal commonants. Okay, but if you're keeping all four, then my company use the Ozill to use, right? You do not need to you're trying to keep off four components. There is no point in doing in all these math calculations, okay? So we we have to find. So, principal one, Principal Comonant 2, Principal Commonant 2, Principal Comant 3, and Principal Cominant 4. Okay. But we will check, like, just like our infograph, we have something c a screen. Yeah, This is a scot. So in this plot, where about the airb is coming, we''ll that as the as the best number of congs to keep. So in this example, we can see, and clear what is coming in, but two is also not bad, right? In two or we are getting an element. But for four to three is no, we are not reducing much. So, there is a trading between accuracy and moderity when you reduce the defensions in most cases, you lose some information. But if the case of Iris Iris is already classes, right? Only setos is always very far apart from other two classes. So we can see that accquacy is a bit increasing when you take the principal compidence, because the principal comment is more synthetic values. Okay. So more stronger values. So let us as like I acquac English very useless in the commerce, but in other like dietes, which we are going to use in your data, in your lab, and youivil lingu increase. So initially it was 75 something, and it's going down to 69 or 70, or 71. We have to decide for how much we can accommodate from 75 can we go to we only go until 73? Or is it talking if we go to 69? Okay. So medical thereasets we don't want to lose a lot of information. So we may tend to keep 80% and 90% of information. For other than us, even 70 is not bad. So we get two settings are there, one weekend said, how many information how much information we want to keep, 70%, 80%, 90%, 73%. That's frauding number of y point83. That is 83% or 0.9 to 92% we can decide how much percent of information we want to keep or we can specify how many compments we want to keep. There is a factor for N components, I'll show that. We can decide how many number of components we want to keep. So either number of components we want to keep we can set, or how much information we want to keep that we can set. Makes sense? Yeah?. For four attributes, PC1 means P So it has four. That means one n is slight this, one n is like this, one is like this, and one is like this, okay? So, PC1 is creating So, it can create still new new four axes, okay? But the first, so the map will measure that, the first axis will have the maximum information. It's between two by 2. So over here, read some lens, you added to Yeah, is spinning up have four axes, two like this and one will be like this, one will be like this, right? Four axes. Okay, I cannot draw it. I can show like this. So like one, two, then the next will be like this, three, and the next fourth will be like this, okay. So four new axis can be created, okay? But the map will make sure that the first axis will how the maximum information. Second axis still how. So assume the first coverage is keeping 65% of information. Okay. The meaning is, 35, right? So then. So first to cover this keeping 65%. 65 percentage. Then, if this is keeping 20 percentage, that means first two conferences having 18,5 percent of information. Okay. In that case, if you are looking for only 80% percentage of information you can just use only first to commerce. You can skip three unformed. Yeah? So, when you do the vure calculation, which are a component gives you the maximum various, that is the bus task. So or four axes have variations. purpose in this point. So when you still get the first one, second will be orthoral to the first one. And third will be orthal to the first and secondge, or in two company clerk,. And fourth will be orthomal to the first three. So first two are staying like this. third will be like this way. Fourth will be point like this. This will be part. Yeah? What's the. When you say, like, percent of information, is that a number you cfe through the entropy loss or how do you determine? is associate we are going to work with. We have only four points, but five points, four points, and we will work with the full calculation to this. Okay? Sorry, what is it four lenss, we have to attributes. But then we have four for PC four of these are engaged in our calculation? Yes. And we are created four new assessor. But even though four or four, so we have saer legal, better leg, and better bit are there. So when you get a PC one, we can name PC1 of any of this. PC1 is that combined information of all these four. P into is a information of all is four, but less information. PC the information of all these four. right remaining information, not overlapping. What they overlapping? Like this one taking 65% in 20%, how do you know that it's not taking information of those 65% as well? So that's why to age or to. So when we do the map of it, you may understand it. Yes. Will you be posing the Excel sheet? It's already there. Not incel sheet for auperior format. I put more explanation there. there. There is a This is probably. So I provided people understand what's happening. So I put more information here. So even if once we finish this full thing here into race class, some students may not fully understand this. This is a bit difficult, not an easy concept, like the math of it. So that's why I put this here. We'll work with the sheet, but to reche or if anyone misses something, you can just check this document and I' understand that just more expression there. Okay? Sounds good. Oh, well just next, um. Sp floor like ditch. So when I talk about the math I get on the board is So now we are going to talk about LDA. After discussing LDA, I'll give a break and then start the back, okay? So, when we talk about this patch, we haven't talk about the class at all. Okay? So this point, maybe from two different classes. Maybe these points are, maybe this is class one. This is class one, this is classass one. And this is class, this is class 2. Okay. So PCA is not consuming the class information at all. Take all the points and trying to see, axis that's spreads this point the max. Class information is not considered in PC, so that's the PC is called an unsuvised technique. Okay? It's class col is not considered, that means the technique is unsupervised. But LD, similar approach, but keeping the class information or so in consideration. Okay? So in the case of PCA, we want to make a new axis such that the spread is max. In LDA, we want to make sure that points, like classes, like the separability between classes should also be maximum. So we are constring the class information also in the caluation. So we want to make sure that there should be separation between classes should be maximum. And the point within each class, the distances for those, so those should be closer. Okay. So points from each class should be from class but should be closer to each other. Poised from class two should be closer to each other. And classes should have maximum distance. Under that's true? So conditions.. Yeah, Max, so we want to have the classes should. So if you have boys. So basically what you are doing is that you take the class, mean of the class one, and mean of the class two, and the distance between that to those two m should be the max. Okay, that means those class are foreart. So I have. So my first class is something like this. My second class is something like this. So me of this class would be somewhere over here, right? Yeah. And mean of this class points are somewhere over here. So if, so if I have, so I'm transferring this distance, okay? Yeah. So bichever access give this distance the mass, but it's condition. I cannot have different axes, right. I can have different axes. Soable axis give me the maximum distance between the bees and the same gi, minimize the variation among the points of the same class. The same logic, but the differenceces, there comes string that class also indration. But the point? Yeah, a little bit? Yeah. Okay. That is so is this technique because class is also considered.. Yeah. So the main across this room PC and PCA is, Elo are not considered the class level at all. We are trying to see the the that maximizes their distances, massize the variances, in a case of LDA, because that class also, we want to find the axes that matimizes the difference between disturbs between the classes at the same time. minimizes the distance between the points in the same class. So I have the is created, maybe something like this. If I have a new axis. So this is my new ais and so as you I have two new axes, okay, to come there. This is axis one and axis two. So my points. So in this one is giving me. And But the other one is giving me something like. Which one is best? only to these taxes or dissists. Why? E. So this is transport. These points are closer to each other. These points are closer to each other, and the distance between the classes are more bigger than this distance. So in this case, we can see a suppression, but still the distance is this much distance for this class, this for this class. And between this distance, this is B two and this is D one Okay. So D1 is bigger than D2, and this so two things are transferred simultaneous. This distance, this value plus this value, this value plus this value, and this value and is value. Underst? Yeah, that is the basic logic of LD. Sounds good. Yeah? You guys start to read a little bit more, because it's not an easy concept. So more reading is required. I tried my level p to draw pictures and I sp, but still leave may need a little bit more clarity, yeah. Can you say that PCA preserves the distanceances between the points or the spread and LDA preserves the classes the separability and the class and the point spreads. Can use LDA for a regression too, or does it have to be labels have to be classification? Do we have to be a label class? Um..Cause we have numbers, we don't have class to separate the means or then we have numbers as a result, right? Can we use LDA here? What I explained now is to reduce the dimensions. Correct. How to reduce the dimensions, for if you have 10,000 features, you can find maybe from 10,000, you can preserve 90% or 80% information by keeping only 50 features. 50 new features. And those 50 features will be representing around 85% of the information. Inst instead of 10,000 instances, features is giving me 100% information, but my 50 features, new axis, new features, is giving me 85% information. So the complexity between the difference between 15 versus 10,000, that's what I was explaining now.. But so we can't use that with LDA for classification. If you have a class. Yes, check. But if you have a number, if it's regression, it can be still use LDA or you can't use LDA. I have to think about your question. I haven't used it, so I have to think. I mean, if it's just about reducing dimensional, you would ignore the class in. What were you do you ignore the..D, we are keeping the colour.. Ald, the.. are just finding the new answers on the new new board. So once you get the new anxis, you have to find the poems on the new axis. So you are getting these principal covenant means a new axis. Now we have to find the points, the already existing Saradized data is there. The Saram Saradized data has to be transformed to this new axis. So finding principal combinants means we are finding new axis. You are not finding new points. And then, so in fight we have we have to initialize the object for PCA. Then we are fitting. There is a fitter operation. Even for analyz, we have a fit operation, right? Yeah. What is the fit operation of sunrise doing? Fit of sunrise. Fitting.. Fitting? So, what is done by fitting in a sumation? Or interview? What is not by fitting? Finding the minimum distance between the... Standized station. Standization? What is the meaning of fitting? What do you want to calculate if you want to standardize some data? The mean and aation. So fitting means you're finding the mean and sanuration. That is the only thing that is happening when you fit is sanariz object onto a train set. Okay? And then you are transforming. Transform operation, actually apply this need half standard deeration, which you found during the feet operation that will be applied on the detacet to find the new sterilized vs. Okay? So finding the main and standardation, that is what is happening with the forish. Wait. Okay? So fop is just to find the may and san deadiation in the case of sanzation. So there's a fit, there is a transform, and there's a fin transform. Three meths are there, right? In py. Three metres are there. Fit operation, we' find the mina s divation. If you're using F transform, so it's basically in the case of train set, you get you can use F trans, fit undercore transform. That means you are finding the miner sanination and transforming those values into the new sanarized values. In the case of test set, you do not need to find the medium sgation. For the test set, you will be applying the same mean and standard deviation of the train set onto the sets. test set. Right? So that means you are only transforming for the test set. Agree. At least, that is some tests to be done, even if you are doing it differently. That is wrong. So operation will calculate some calculate the next sanation. So the which should be upright on the train set, so the mina sation should be calculated, and then we have to transfer using the miner Sarad deation to find the new stadized values. Once your stadze it, you receive that main will be zero and SD will be one for the new transformed vbs. Okay, In this case of PC, also fing, when you fit you have to initialize the object of PC and then you have to fit it during the fitting time, you're finding the new axis. You are getting principal comments. That means you're getting new asses. Okay. And then you' to find the values, you have to transform the original values to the values of this new anx. That is done with a transfer operation.. Okay? So when you do the last thing about it, the paste, you will see everything initialization, feet transform, or initialization, to transform, transform. You're to understand what's happening during that time. Make sense. Yeah. So would you need to remember my name is wake a PCA appointment to? When you do normalization, you a new aisable is your name? So the way that I explained is passing through the whole. That means it has to be starized. There are different variations of explanation is there for PC. So there is mean standard explanation. There are some literatature to me about means centre data. That means it is not standardarized in taking out the me. Okay. different the way that I explained is, working on the standardized data. That means it will be centred about the origin. So that means my life will be passing through the origin. Gee, I have to think about a line here to check. Well, just nice. Okay, I'll give you a shortwich and let's try a map out of that. Okay, baby, wait, the orange Christmas.. Oh. Don send the passwordport outside. Ben, you send the Prosod outside, you can't this. So this is mod assumptions, like here, I mean if you are short and you are really fast, if the to your theory. So don't take risk. Don't the password outside. if you give us the wounds.. Christmas change the giant? Just bs. It's just a motivation to come to the class, that's it? And what points for you guys. Okay. You should be able to see it. You have three minutes to do it. So take your time and do it. Don't simly rush.? is first. F honesty. First. in, I. First, FIRD. Most of you I know, sausage? Yeah, yeah. Okay. I get outage.. Lord me, I have to take adance. Christopher., Baltimima. Hey. James.. Justin. Le.. M. Michael. Nicollay. Ben Hu. Here..... Sal and Guys, don't set the passer outside. Sheyika. Joan. Joan. No.
