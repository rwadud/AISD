So we have a we have a classes for from two classes So one, two, three, five boys class. Next is class two. When we take the averageages, we take the average based on class. Okay. So this me is coming from the main of these five points. Okay we are not doing this in class, but the logic is like this. The aopticity is too. yet Mars this projector before butterfl or the the district between the classes should be the maximum at the same time. boys, the same class should be like more closer. Yeah. So we considering the class, but we consider all of the points at each set. Yes. In each leg is class like class. So is also able to take the class, watch, at class. So in the case, you are just taking the comments matter. Not p not class. Here, everything is class p. So one thing I not is that I was randomly taking the subject to the submitted for one, you are not explaining. So what is this love mis? Like, what is the new thing that we learn in this love? The new thing that we learned in this love. what you say? Is, right? And it specifically mentioned in the parame. So a parame set that specifies the number of formants. So what are the possible for that? Are the maximum for that? Can is set any number of founders. What is the maximum for PCA? Yeah, the number of? Number of technically, number of art producers, or number of ins samples, which one is last, the red that we normally work is like a less napa. So minimum number ofms or number of features. That is theition for PC. What about LD? Oh, gosh, number of classes. numbers. So the maximum is should be based on number of classes. So, and we want to have a separator between two classes. How many separators we are belie? We have If we have two classes, if they want to separate, how many I want I wanted to draw lines to separate this class, how many lines do I have to draw? One, right? Yeah. So if we just two classes, we have to draw one line. If we have three classes family lines. So I assume that we have one whole class here. We may have to drawow. We may have to draw something like. So we need to have a line to separate between these two and then form lines. Three lights, right? So basically the the number of us minus. So if you have three glasses, two two colours. five classes, four coll. Okay. Okay, so. recommendation. And for this, like, every structure should be explained, but here I after to explain the number of progress here. There are specifics for that., you will lose points. Okay. So you have to explain how many, what what is that parameter? You have to explain that parameter the parameter. Obviously, you have to tell. What is that, like, part of what is the possible values, So what is that? And. Yeah, so you have phil offer today. You refer to the So here to be minimum of number of class minus one, or a number of Egypt. We number, we however, two classes. Right, two classes, and diamond is right. diiamond is right. Yes. Yeah. So we have so if they're using LDA, we have two classes that means here is one and eight feet. So what is minimum, one or eight, that is the number of comments you can create. Okay? So don't forget to why these things in your l, because finishing the lumps pretty easy. Like, my objective is at least try to document other things, you will learn. The was on this. In the exam, I' giving some data this number of features, this number of classes, this number of samples. How many p you can make? Okay. So almost a short question yet. The number will be different, but the really a question like this, like, I'll be telling, okay, we have read us five classes, 20 features, and Cmles. How many bonus? How many little bonus you can make, with C and how many corners we can make it'll be? without knowing these con get this appro. So make sure that you, when you do this love, go to the documentation, all these speed learn new, you have to make sure that you know those parameters. Okay, Makes sense. Okay, so any of what's nice? Okay, so last last we did PCA. I went to the map of PCA try to do it by yourself. Okay, that'll be a question. near L two to do this with a suppress set of numbers so that that is my way of forcing you to do it. But if you decide, okay, I don't want to want that much fine, but because you should know what's happened, right. So today we are going to learn a classification. support. So how many classitution whether we learn so far? Decision. Decision rate..... And then.ificationribation is to get predict a value, like house price, sun cost, a little, but we can use the n job to perform classification, I just. value they get sending it to a function, Sima function and that function will the value is where than 0.5, plus, less than 0.5 other plus. So we have that car or. So this is this normally comes an advanced to technic support. I tried my my 11 touce in a very very day. Let's see how we'll go, okay? So it's not an easy thing.. So. So we have two classes. We have two classes, blue boy and red boys. Okay?. So if I want to create the things, right? We have to go to line, right? I guess I can draw a line. And that line is the histr class. So line based only some lines I can use to supply right. Okay, I I can draw a line. own these lines which I drew here our old barrel. Okay. So in the course of your support better machine, so in, we can see the picture. What about 20hip? We see just a picture, right? Okay? But to introduce the topic they use to need to show studio 3 to enjoy that show. But always think, we can have the ships. We can have hundred dimens ships. So it's not easy to draw and find the line, okay? So here, the concept is. So assume that as, I just. So this is my glasses. So I can draw a line like this, right? Yeah. Is this a bus line in the scenario? Is this the bus light in the scenario? Why? The, Blue is safe in one day, but red points are not safe, because I can get a red point, maybe summer over here. My next red point is here. So basically this is like an all fitted, overfitted line for the red class. We get also this is over fitting for the red qu, right? So this line is not that great. I' same piper flight I can create for blue points also. In this case, my red points are safe, but by blue is not safe, okay? So you can go to our fitting. So I can't have some of the line like this, but I'm not to find aine. Okay, I have to find the in line that is not our five, that is not kind of, okay? For that, the concept that support v mission uses this basically it is so it is trying to create magic, for example, So I want to create a margin between these two classes, okay? This is a possible possible margin, right? Yeah. But if I put like this this is the possible if I create my marches like this, if I create my margin like this. you can see I have points like this, and. So my boss is canandy have underman, which is a little bit more wire. Okay. I have under. So this is one I made. So just remove it from here. So this is what I created. But now I'm going to create other world. This is one I'm trying to pre. Okay. This is a little bit more wider than this margin, right? Yeah? More can separate these soins. Okay, both the advise margin and second margin can separate this blue points andpoise. copy. Okay? But is this the opposism of the supportmission is, we have to find, we have to maximize this model. Okay? We have to maximize this margin. So in this one, basically my first points are my reference points are,age. So this is one our first sp I use to create a sm. And the next two our first spine I use to create this mginous, So this is the point that these are the two points that use that as reference's points to create this mark. Okay? So if I keep so once I create this model, I need to only these two points, right? All of the points are relev in my scenario. Okay? But if this case, I have I'm concerned this point, this point, this one and. So these boys. So basically, our objective is to create the maximum force of margin. And the points that help us to create that maximum possible margin are gold, support measures. Understood? So support factors means those points that help need to create a margin with a maximum build. What a point. Yeah. So now if you look here, so this word is word margin, this is. So this is, I think this is the I just datically created this. So this is the maximum the biggest margin I can get. And these points are course support betters. So the course of your sub support is simple, if we explain it this way. So in that two day, we want to create separation between classes, we can have multiple way of separations. Okay? a shorted before, we can have different types of lines, all these les of supplers, right? Yeah. So be light gives me the maximum of separation between the classes, that is what we are what we are trying to achieve. Understood? Yeah. what the point. Okay. So now, how can we find this? How can we find this margin? So plification in this business fit me. So in one dimension, it's a. Because you are just boys from one dimension, the separate is a lot, right? Yeah. C is something like. If you have something like a, like a one dimension, and we have boys, like. So this is my one dimension. Okay. And my pins are like. What? He's the band. He's the band? Okay, so we can make it bigger. Okay, so my points are are my points for class one, okay? And I have a class two points here. So my suppter will be Air Dodge, right? Yeah? It's aod in one. When I have two dimensions, when I have two dimensions, I have two eyes, like a size and baxis. I cannot points. My red points will be like this. And my blu points will be something like this. And I adult is not enough to separate these two classes, right? So I should a line to separate these two classes. When it comes to three dealersships, we should have it. We should have a plane includ in, okay? More than three dimens ships, we should have a hyperlane.. That is that is the nature of the subway. So, let just reduce the hydroplain first, this is between the hyopplane, hands of veuses the hyperplane. That is for the classification part. Understood? Yeah, this much. Yeah. So now, what are support, I guess?ort are the po that are closer to the hyperpl? Once they have the plane there,rop, and can influence the position. So comparing between these two, okay? If this one, this are a sub propitors. Okay? So it might support factors. can. I'm just decide some spand orientation of my my. Okay? So if I support my just these four, these four, then my dish more, right? Not. Support really hy the position and orientation h. Okay. So using the support by TC maximize that classation mark. I' Mrs. Bor is one me, D line tol, and then it will be hyperl. Sounds so up. Yeah. Anybody has any questions? Yeah. Is there way to check the points are separable in the line or a plane or high hyperplane? starting the process, is there a way to check the line those points may be scattered into In real life, we won't get points like this for. more ways, that'll be all, that we get points in in the US. So what so we talk about that a little bit later. So we' think that so we have more ships, we can not up, make that we learn last week, which is to reduce the dimensions, okay?uce to two and we can visualize. That's why we have to reduce one reason of producing, it is one dist is to produce the compressity at the same time visualization is very important. Unless we have no proof how it looks like, right? Like how can we see whether the line is separating or not? It's not possible. we can find it by creating a line and finding accquaccies. If we are we are getting this classifications, obviously, that is all about it. Okay? Like, before creating a mind, we can not find birth to have a suppable plans. Okay, any other questions? Okay, so,. What is my supervis running? It has class. classation. That means. mostly commonly used for the classification task. Now they are going to the math of it. I don't know how much I can do. I can make you a list in your hat. Maybe in stuff, we'll go over it today and maybe before the start of the demo. I can take maybe 10 more going to say extra. My expectation is, water tiss you today, you will go and rough up to it, and then come back on Monday and if you have questions I can go the day. Maybe you won't get it in one stretch, okay? So,. So, we have these points. Okay, red points, blue points. We are getting a new point. We are getting a black point. When we see the picture like this, Dino is the blue point. But that's not the case, we don't have the picture. Ask you that we don't have the picture. How can we tell whether this boy is on the blue side or on the other side? That is not a tusk, okay? To achieve that. So we have is a model already created. This gr line is a model. Okay. This green line is sort of model. So I'll make a duplicate of this life. I not I will subject to remove Next year, we have two sl. Okay, so, so we have this green point. So a green line here, okay. So in a normal logic, we can think, can we find the closeness to the screenline. Okay, but to bear to the green line.. The line itself has multiple points on it, right? Yeah. If you want to find a distance between this p to the green line,. You find the projection, right? Yeah, we haven't there yet. And just to show him, what is the problem? So I'ume that if you want to find a distance, we can have a line like this, we can have underline, if you have a question? Yeah, so you were it's like a quier machine. You were that why you in the right side. Yeah, so how can we do that? It's a less than a certain volume? Yeah, but to where? So the like we have this line here and we can't have different types of lines, right, not just one lines. So I can have a line like this, okay? Or I can have.. I was wondering because you have some, when you have out? in a certain region, right? No, no, no.. I do that. I classify this point as that point or blue point, okay? So one way that they can be made thick is like to find a distance to this point to green line. But where to the green line, is that we do know to work to the green line. So we don't have it in our first year. Who is jok Don't talk us. Do we know that we know in advance or do we choose it? We know that we are in advance, but to the Green, we do not we are not steam the Green life. This is somewhere, okay? In in the higher dimension. We cannot see it. So, for that, the next step, the next step thing is, because we should have some criteria, okay? Some criteria, that should be applicable for any point, anywhere in this indiversional space, not for just one point. Next time, this black point any summer over here, okay? So it should be working for points, anywhere on this individual space, or vectors on vectors, which are on anywhere, on the international space, okay? So for that, the first thing is, we will create. So, if we have some plantation, we can make some some meaningful lines, okay? So what I'm going to do here is. I am going to wait a line that is perpic to this green one. So that is the mathematical standard, right? I can create something or something, okay? So if I put okay, create a light perpip to create a line to perpendector to line one. So that is that I can tell for any that's a standard statement I can make. So simply to draw your line, does it make much sense? We do not know where to wear, right? So it's not simply., it's simply simply creating some sware, we are going to create a line, which is perp to the existing green wine. Underwear so far. Okay. So this middle coin has ve up, because what does a vector, right? To send them in of space. So this is going to be called, so this is the point X. So this is the point x. And I am going to preach... The W. So you normally see X and W. So that's we are using the same paper names. So I have. So Iume that this is the paddle. Does this up, right? Something like this, okay? You just know what we if we did the 90 deg just to be the. So we have this vector created. And this is a point, this is the point in question. We want to predict for this point. Okay? So I'm going to create other better for this S. So I'm going to come to this X also as a vector. So that means I should have. Yeah? Okay. So, everyone is with me? Yeah, okay. So now. find that this so if I want to find this sense, or I can find the measurement by projecting this on this, right? Yeah, because this has a standard. I have a perpend so I can find the perpendicular distance because I feel I have a formula for that. So I wanted to project this on this, this better X or better. What is the projectjection device? D product, okay? I project, that is the drug product. So.. When I projected this on this, that is X.. And I forgot to mention one thing, Once I create this vector, I have an assumption, my assumption is. assumption is the distance between the perpunular distance between this point to the oddsit is some feet. Okay. see., this is not as simple as this KM or physry or Kes, okay? So you' to pay attention. Try a little bit to understand this. If not, we can go go over it one more time, but don't get discourage. There's math inage. We cannot avoid math in machine running. Okay, so this terms Vieting as. Okay. This as C. To the dert between theical distance they see. So I'm going to project this X onto the W, which is that product, right? X d w, right? Okay, to product X and W. If don't product does X and W is equal to the C, what is the meaning of it? The. If the d brought the court of XW is equal to the value, what is the meaning of is correct? The relative dest make sure the question. if the product, just down on the. Okay? So if that is the same as C, what is the meaning of it? X is. Excess on the green line. Okay. X is on the green line. And if it is greater than the sea, that means. It's is that. If it is less thanancy, it's the blueboard. Everyone underst so far. Yeah. Okay. Let me see what is here. Yeah, this is what I have for so far. Okay? So, if you const red as positive side and b us negative side, negative negative and positive points. For the positive points, they question we look like.w, greater L. Wait. Ex door, is for the positive points. Yeah, agree? Let me finish this, okay? So if W is where than see, is the quality, then we can take the C onto the left side that least X door W minus C is cleario. W soft far? We just took up the C also to the last side. Okay, so there's no sign change. So X dw minus C is by 0. Now we are going to represent this minus C as B. Okay, we are represent with this minus C as B. Okay? So that means it will be X door w plus B, greater that zero. We just took this minus C and just just representing this with other variable name would be because our creation we need as like just like any line equation, we have like MX plus B, right? That's for much. Okay. So here this is a plane, so extra W. We need to get in that format. That's the only reason we have a person this minus as under deli name to be. So our equation becomes plus C is gradez. Okay? Yeah. So now. we can tell if it extra the rain, B plus B, that is supposed to be. Okay? So now we have a person that question is why equals plus one, if w.s or so. plus B is where go to or minus one, if this is less than zero. I'm not sure. Yeah? Okay. It is always a line or can it be a spor? L nat. So I cannot draw in space, so for the explanation, I am showing it in. It is a lot. But mathematically, it's a plate. So that's why.. It would be straight, but it would be a cloud line, but it's it's it's not a line in individual space. Okay. So now I's see the point relies to the land side. It's so equal to see. So our pos is we have to Okay? So just as we we do the foundation, so we are assigning the points to the cluster based on the distance to the centids. The distance is say, still classign, one or to the other, right? Okay. So we this equations based on like if of manly cing this in some programming assuming that we are recording this in job. It's based on a little states. Okay. But we have to, we don't have a third class here. So one or the other, we have to assign, either to the third or to the blue. Okay. Okay, so I think everyone for this, I'll just yeah, got it. Do we calculate the line after each point or no So we are notset. Do we find the new line after the new point? Like after you predict this new unknown point, you recalculate the line or you keep it? the green one. Does it change? Green light? Yeah, can you recalate. Okay. add more points. Okay, so this green line creation and this extra creation is all these things are happening together. All these things are happening together, and Greenland is the more that they create. Okay? So just like if you have randomly you're drawing your life, okay, that is a separate they created. Okay? And then for the predictions. like if I are concerned it year, I think you will ask me about this line and the things that I explained for this black point is the prediction, based on the green line, okay? So, a few things are there, we can chw these parameters, that we're talking a bit later, okay? How to get, because there's a testing phase and revalation and creating the right mor. So testing and just like across theation, okay, they're creating the correct two modets. So correct model is based on a trade between acquacy and complexity, right? Yeah? So those updations are happening, but once the model is finalized, then there's notation. What the point? Yeah.. So in one of the classes, we talk about this is the week slide for parameter. So we'll talk about grid research and run and search, okay. So I thought we'll talk about more about the ting. Okay, I'm happy that you guys are getting the point, is good. In some classes, I really str like sort of, get you touching, whatever effort I put, they won't get it. So at least you're getting at least some of the courses, right? Good. What's smashed? Okay, so now. So we already got under this much, okay? Under this miss, we already finalized. This previous sl was finalizing that patch. Okay? No, we have to find a slide, right, okay? In the good, but I have to find these lines. So now, because the course concept is about the margin. We need to, our separator, our line, Shi, creating the maximum postal margin between the classes. Yeah, that is theation. Our Cation is two is to create a line such that if two pel lights are drawn to that line that would we have the maximum margin. Okay, that is, okay? So, uh Where is he Where is It's over... So, Martin D the different D is the difference between.. Here these two lights. So between everyone and two, that's the m, or short here, the v of this is D, or the vict of this is deep, but we want to find that that's specific specific line that maximizes D. maximizes marking or the invariable chubs can use available. Okay. Um Yeah. So now, um, so I'm getting two other lines. So this is WX plus B plus. So I'm getting two par lines. WXB, Ww.expb. What is this? Hey. So one of the light side, one on the left side, because my objective is located by semester. Okay? So if I want to see whether this is max based or not, I should have two far ls, okay? So, one person you can ask is why is WS plus B equals one? Why can't be fun? You can. It would be a multiply. Like, it is not called to make a change, just like the one I showed something last week. What was I showed. For the PC calculations, we were like the egg and various, we were checking. TS1, okay? I sure what was happening in this, okay?. So for the easiness for the convenience that's in in literature, you will see the word convenience, okay the convenience, you are going to use the use the value word. So line one is WX plus D equals minus 1, line 2 is WX plus D equals 1, Okay? So for the red points, the condition will be it should be greater than. Sp from this line, right? And for the blue boy should be less than this line. Yeah, when we grow these two lines, for the blue coin should be lower that one, for the red point, should be higher than L. Okay. So that condition can right this like this, because correct points is clear should be clearly to one and we are just writing the same condition by multiplying this by YI, YI can be one or minus one, okay, based on a sign. Understood? So this instead of filing this two equations separately, we are it has one equation, but we put the conditions like this. YI, there's one for a point and YI equals minus one for blue point. Nakes sense? Yeah? Okay. So now we have two plan. Elon and L2 are two planes, and what we are trying to maximize is the distance between these two planes, right? Yeah. We want to find a plane such that, the parallel planes, we have the maximum distance between them. Okay, so we want to match, we want to fight Elward and El2 such that the distance between them should be the maximum. We can have many animals are in two. We can have slightly slatterered and another two, right? Just to draw like here. We can so if I answer to this as, this is, this is L2. Right. So I want to find that's specific that has the maximum margin. Okay. So I want to maximize the Dband or the margin band. Oh, okay. Okay, so again, is little algebra. E equation for equation for the distance between two plates. If a planes like WX plus B, equals 3, and WX plus B plus minus. It's a formula. You are not going to learn the proof of it. The formula is this to value C2 minus1 by the N. Okay. So here, equation is 1 minus one, right? Yeah, our lines there with that equals 1 and equals minus 1. Right? So the distance will be, minus 1 minus is big two, minus 2, absolutely minus 2. So two over the kn.. Two over thee the n, which is from the case of W, you become W1 square, plus W is the n. So this is formulaize to by the kn. That is the distance formula. Okay? So this is a fal enough to we have to lie. In math classes, if you are doing anegrad in math, you will in the product, you will the two. this situation became. But for us, we do not need to let the proof of this, but we should know that this is the formula. If we have two planes, the distance between those two planes, two planes in this format, WX, same W on both sides, same B on both sides. C is minus an plus, then the formula would be like this, okay? Par, basically distribute to par out. It's. So, our objective is to maximize this test, right? So what is D? We want to maximize it, right? object. So objective is maximize the distance. subject to these live auditions. What this line condition, you already covered this, right? This is the line condition. Oh, these are the line conditions. For red points,, it should be in two line for blue points. It should be below below the Lver line. Okay, that is the condition. And that is the condition and get that condition, we want to maximize the distance. Okay, so we want to maxify the distance such that. Rut points up above the and points are below the line. Yeah? Okay? Yeah, okay. So that is that foundation that we have to understand. So the board of training is B is maximize this distance. Mr. S is to by, no, as subject subject to that transr. One class should being, class should be below the transponding line. That is the is for the linear, if there is the class has suffered. Okay? So the class is a hard margin, so we are not acceptting any this classifications. So this is called a maximum margin classifier. So we are maximizing the margin. We are producing a classifier by maximizing the margin. That is called a maximum margin classifier. And here are two subs that means we are not accepting any mislassifications. Understood. Yeah? One question. So when we have the X, y and a few dots, the colour is the class.. And the X and y is the colour or the active. the features. like length and width. Okay, so what about if you have two columns, but three classes? Yeah, so it would be like, so class one versus class two, class one versus class 3, class 2 versus class 3. Also 1 versus 1. That we get a line for any. Okay, so what I will do is I'll process one into threeight. Yeah, so give me a break now. and then he'll go to Nlinear SV after the break.
in real life, classes. And you have you have, okay.. It's very, very, very rare. have such a to have that scenario in the life. So when you look at the price of the, you have that here, is for a. That means this would be help to work. We have to find a way. to work with the non smer class, right? Yeah. is the second case. So if you example are provided here. So how can we create, how can we create a separator for this case? One option is, you can go with the suppator, but accepting it in this classifications. Because use the same conor in the margin, okay? But we will set, how much. So, at that time, we have one more condition, not just the maximum, at the same thing we know, we have a value. How much, how much this classifications we are willing to and search. Okay, maybe two percentage. Okay, or one percentage, or five percentage. So I can that value. So the parameifications. So in this case, anyway, on this side, I look at these three points classified, right? blue points, these play blue points. And in this side, these two are points are being specified, okay? So but in this case, let me this screenshot.. Sleep interviews, not available to interview. The bookage. Love it. Okay, so, when I create margin. So, this can also be a separator right. Yeah, in this case, this stoid is also because of clite. okay? But by some reason, if I can, this is the best. I can't go with it much. I should have the condition that I can I can accept. Okay? So that is the what is another condition that we have to set. How many how much person have mispators? We are willing to? Okay. The previous condition is still there, we are to maximize. We have to find a play with the maximum maximum margin provided, we can accept this in a number of this classifications too. Okay? That is called a support Better classifier, so that the brain one must, maximum not classifier. Maximum margin classier, we are not related to accept any dis classifications. Like these classes should be. No, what we're talking about is the support metter classifier, which means we are going to the Ler classifier, but we are planning to accept some these classifications. Okay, Sounds good. That's chillers, and we understand how wish this classification be again after? How much M of this classification we are willing to. And based on that for, the margin will be created. Nice says? Yeah. Now, this is other case, See, this one, no way that I can create a classifier for the reader classify for this one. Right. Yeah? There's no way but I can create a leader classify for this case. Okay, so we can found this type of a classes, we can have classes like this. So what can we do in this place? In this case, the best of approaches, oh, like, if you mind anything, can we lift these? Okay, can we project this work at a points into some high dimiversion? so that once it is projected, the will be a suppression between Ru. Can we do something like that that's the question, okay? The objective is to for object. These points, so currently is two in enough, okay? My objective is two project this into fire issues. I do not know how many I want to create. Okay, my objective is to. Project this to do higher ds. such that is some dimens, maybe 20., maybe 200 I is not top. How many dimensions I want to 12? But what'situde then, I will do this production process. I'm. I'm. The po where I get a separation between this so basically I'm trying to I'm trying to make this and not support problem into a sub problem by projecting the schedule hired initial space. Okay. But how did it? Yeah? What's the point? So that is the plan. Which, Project 50 is points tolet and an extimate number of very, very fine. Okay. Projecting because this is just true, right? In real life, we may have 100 dimensions. 100 feet in theory have, and 100 features connected to inf different number of dimensional space is highly complex and with high competational poster. Okay. It is not an easy operation. It is not just a square two or a varile, cubing a value. higher information means infinite number of dimensions can have. Okay? So it's not computationally good, so a high compet computational will be there. So for that, there is something called car trick, okay? Car trick is in plain language, it is basically taking the god for concept of God. Okay? Basically taking the concept of d product. That means that'sumption will find these values without specifically raising all these points to high em measures. With the projecting these two higher dimensions, this colal function will do the same activity or give the same value, same answers, without without projecting into higher dimensions. So theology is work. Okay? So we are not going to do the mark of it, but you have to understand what is it doing? This, cannot look if you're doing. So until that just I have a 10 feature. Maybe the piano function is working, so that, I will get them as friends. If I project this point into 10,000 depressional space. Okay, I'm not projecting these points to 10,000 dimensional space, but it's clinel function will do the truth. Okay? So we marking our understand about the care is, K function, that will, that will, that will make sure that it will do the dot calculations, and we will give the results in their day or the results that they can get easy projected into higher developions. without projecting. That is called a current. So there are multiple can are available. So if we go to go to SC, this is a parameters that they are doing a worker. If hesis lasia, it won't the consummation. It won't do thections, it will just create the classifier. If I set carely, okay? You are not having a separate function format. We are using SPC and we said Lasia if we want to have a in a separator. But we have other options. We have other options, you, are the option, which can create foreignomous subors. I think that have a picture some. Um. One of these princes have a picture for that to show the polynomial polynomial car.. It would be like if it is court right, if you know how a quart function looks like, right? Yeah. So for me, what a dimension, we have that very type of cur will be created. You can have a polomial supp. But this is the most to widely used radial basis function. This is the most to widely used. This will make sure that until the classes are separable, the function works like it is projectedly to higher dimensions until the classes becomes the problem. Okay, that is the foundation. So in the case of are specifying their degree, you have the option to specify the degree. But in the case of a little basic function, it will do the work, and until we get a situation where the class I saw your hand. Sorry.. So, a little bits function is working in a way that it is it gives the values like in such a way that if we do the projections until this class arered, it will do the projections, okay? That is RBS. So RBF will make sure that part. But it is very expensive. It is very expensive. It is widely used, but make sure that whether we need to use it all much. Okay? So if we check the literature, this is the the value for every parameter is a defa value, right? So this for to value for p is. But I have this is one sample. So if I use via turn, so I'm creat support by just basics, have ploting support by. So if I have I am using linear cl, for this letter seerenaus enough, yeah, because this is after LD. After LDA. So I think this is from the next like the w. It's stuff like that it with some a number of features, but just three classes, so most of these wine data set in three classes. So with three classes, we are so Mediterranean. These two points, these two points, and these four points are not support metters.. But when they use RBM, R radial means, it is finding points around the class. We can see, see, these web points, this kind of r we need to know these red points. There's no point to know points, this point, this blue point, because they are really is a problem, right? But if it is not being as a problem, for example, if we have something like this, we need to have the radial function is radial is required to separate class like this. Makes sense? So I put a radial linear, I've also all this up in the dayall values. Pomin is also creating a lot of coins. Actually, which is the last. In this three cases, which is the best? The first one, we just one, two, three, four, five, is with eight points. Eight points, you can make a very good classification, because these are, this are proper, right, yeah? So this is a polynomial, and this is arbial. RBF is getting points around around the classes. It is not in this case. Makes sense? Yeah. Okay, early. Yes, so are you saying that if you have, say, and mentions of data, you only need K less than any group to projective space. Like if you example three dimensions, if you are able to do No, no, no. That is will do, will go to illate number of dimensions projected to until. Yeah. You say you have the maximum at the end some word number. It doesn't match about the features. Yes. It's about the property. Yes, and then you have some minimum value, and then you go when you go up all like.. No, the condition is when the stuff. So that's case is going to be less than is. If K is the number of separable processes,. If K is the number of separable. No, no, no. So, if this is the case, you do not know until when will this like, maybe protected to the five inersips? Or 10 ships? We do not know when this isartment. It doesn't matter with the is two different things. Yes. No, I mean, if you have seen and you find five dimensions, it is in the best one, you choose five. We were go if the class inensional space. This is not about the features. This is about the projector's space, okay? So you about the projectctions. I don't you about the projectctions. not the features. You't need all the tand in the space. See, if we can separate the classes in five dimensions, not the features.. two different things. Feature, like in the previous case, we're talking about like we have five different versions, means five features. But this dimension space productive intr space is not rel to this feature number of features. It's two different things. Can you repeat that regularial pass of your monactics? I have to record. I' little short. Okay, so the objective is our TV. So if they are doing the projections, our objective is, we will do the projections, maybe to the three, the four, to the five, to the six, to the seven. Until like, whenever we get these classes separable. We're not going to go in, okay? It can go in French. We do not come. That's the RB is very harmless. We can set some like. I got, yeah. Yeah, can. We talk about the next next. about the parameters. So this is this degree is for the polynomia. We talk about the g and the sea later.. So this parameters, what will be like that accept quite that's the next word. Okay. But the objective is two. So multiple things are there. We are willing to accept for his classifications. It's not a hard margin, okay? SC with the camera function. We are willing to accept some disclassifications, which we are going to set. We don't want to overpach. We don't want to underfeit. Both are not good. We already know. underfitting otherfitting are not good. Okay. So we want to get S, which is not our fitting means it is performing 100 percentage. Well, for the frame that. But when new points comes, it' cannot perform by, okay? So that means if if the borders are very close to the existing points. It is just accommodating that specific strict set of points, okay? That is power fitting. So we do not we do not that to happen.. At the same time, we don't want to have marches somewhere. And just performing anything. Like, even the train that does not performing well. Then what's the purpose of that more? Okay. But so there are maximum market conditions, mar should be maximized at the same time, we are willing to act accept some classifications at the same time, we don't want to underfit anyone want to powerit. Okay? All these fips are there when be graved this morning. It's not a single model. The is very common. And in some cases we do not really support by demosi, because support vector machine works really well for complex data. For simple data tests, it's not a wise thing to use supportment machine. You may get even less adurate than other simple matters are be launched. Okay. Okay, so yeah. So basically this is what we learned so far. So maximum was classical is it a hard margin. Okay. Just the margin, we are not ready to accorate any misclassifications, so that means class from this suburb. The support projected classifier which means we are willing to accept some mislassifications, but they classier will be a lead. Okay, so that it will be a hyper that we are going to create. Now, is support machine means, SBC plus nonlinear cl. So that means they can have APs, they can have bonium, we can have sickmoid, different functions are available, we can use as. But we have to decide if there is no shortcut to decide which one is the last. Okay? If you can visualize, you can get some idea. Otherwise, we don't not know how it looks like in a 50 dimensional space. If you have 50 features, we have 50 dim, right? We have no clue how it looks like the 50 dimensional space. Okay. Yeah.. So okay, now I got the parameages. So we don't want to overfeit. We don't want to underfeit. How can we spend that? Okay? So there are two parameters. C and grama. In some literature you can see, you will see that in the rutization parameter. Both say one proportion to the other, it is one over the other. So this is the value that we said to represent how many misclassifications we are willing to. Okay. So if you are beginning to accept a more the specifications, if you are willing to smaller species, higher normalization, which means you are making a wider margin for the hperlane. So we can have one classifications there, but if you put a small value. So that will try to make sure that we are predicting mostly all training status party, which needs to over.. Basically, how much erors we are need to access? That is this particular value. And Gama and Gama are. So how well our models, like if you plain language, if you have two points, how will it be across the separation should be, how closer to that class points? Okay, that is what this particular. The factor that, how the model on the 12 data, that lower value was underf, if it is not fitting well. Obviously underfitting, if it is it is fitting to. Two good. That means, it may end up in our fing, because it will work very well before that, that's too good good suppors will work very well for the given trainer, but when new points come, it may not.? And then, last thing is,ages of machine, higher high average, underst. Sounds good, guys. Okay, let's do the quiz now. So let's do next week on worse, Chris will be happy at any point, maybe I do that at the start of the class or after 10 minutes. At some point, the Chris will be happening, okay? So if you come on last 20 minutes, the quiz. So it can happen. And then we multiple quizes. You telling me this way. Doors is the outside. I'll cancel the news if somebody who talk to the class wives a quiz. Okay, should be available now. When you know the subjects are, Passport is Colonel K E R N E L. shall you. May I ask you? Isor here? Yes. I'm Christopher?. Hey, man!? Gian.. Joseph? Just, I always got confusion between these three. Lee is here.. Mattio? Here. Michael, Michael..? Yeah. V. Shaky? Signing off? Johan. Joan? X I listen, but. E one.
