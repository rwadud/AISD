Please. Here, for each of the classification and resting, there are lots of algorithms. And the game that's required here, it's one of the basic traditional classification algorithm for the classification. Okay. So, then... So, what is the great classic person? So 1st of all, the protagonistic flavour for serving classification problems. So it's based on the conditional probabilities. So what is the conditional probabilities? You know, what's the definition of the program? It will be probability is... the conditional probability. The probability of something occurring something. If you already know some other thing happened before. It's conditioned on some or something like... Okay, so... It occurs to pure... in Sanwide... or join for a beauty of the exam wide. The only fun pure feet. And obscenary, you can write, you know, it's given what, they can't so care. Extend by, or we join probability of the, et cetera, right, multiply PF one, right? So, also, we can write is peaks and wine, or joint parlant tea, in terms of, you know, the interception, it's equals to P of X, Y, equals to P of X, intersection, what? Right? So based on this formula, we can arrive something like this. A p of white, even gigs, it course to p of X, given white, times purified, devoided by pure X. Right? Yes, simply, you can replace, if you're replaced here, this term, pure x and water, with pure void, times pure, it's given, what? Right? You have these kind of.
No. Now, let's use this ingredient curim form classification test. Let's consider each achievement and the stable and the random. So, each of these achievements or features, you consider them as a kind of, like, run over people. Okay. that can take any venue. discreet old continues. So then give me a record week, achievement, 6 weeks to up to X80 is our dimension, feature dimension. The goal is to predict us what. Okay, so we want to know for this existence, for me, it's the same, okay, what would be the class, it's 1st funding class? So we're specifically, you want to find a value of wine, then maximum is this corrupt. If we already given this feature... You want to maximize... Okay. But the question is, can we just see mate, you know, these probability people, if they come? the rever So, you can do that. PY, just give an extra accuracy. X, one, X, two, da dot, X, B, and the one. Yeah, I have a solution, but the answer for this question, you know. So we cannot directly compute this one, just to figure. The... Okay, so we need to find a solution to find our body is to find this probability. Right? I mean, Canada, if you find it from, just, just looking at it. You mean? We need to... Because we don't have to... No, we have it. We have But we don't know, let's say, so, for some samples, for data that you can't find the, you know, fee of X1. If you know the pair of X1, but you need to find the quality of X1, it's too extreme at the same time. Right? That the X one by itself. It's true itself, it's 3 way to serve. also PYD is 2 x one And then PX one, and then even even even, yeah, maybe you really change it, so... So, now the approach. So how you can do it, how you can solve this problem. So we compute the posterior probability, we apply X1, x2, of 2, x, using the page story. Okay, so, based on, we can have, we can rewrite, you know, this equation or this probability in this way. Here apply, given X, one, X, two, X, theorex, and equals to, it should be extinct. Okay. It goes to PFX one, each 2 of Lonix D, human one, pure fly, uh, modify, pill, X one, of 2 games. Right. So, now, maximum, maximum, a posteriri. So, children wine, we want to choose what, we should choose the wine. Once you might, it's probability. Okay, this one. It's equivalent to choosing very long, why, that maximize is work. So if you have a much more value for this one, you should have a maximum value for this. Right? Okay. And now, how can estimate this probability? So, but you think, it is, so, if you have, let's say, what are you saying, what's writing this program? Just thinking this way. If you have 3 customer values for one, like C1, C2, C3, one, 3 tasks. Okay. So we have to 1st find PFC one during this PFC 2 during this PFC train. Hey, give me X one to XD, okay? Then we should check which one is maximum. The probability of the which probability is the maximum. Right? Like the confidence is for. Life the confidence is forwarded. have in your Previously that, so for the sample, for prediction, you have... Okay. So, here is probability can be castered, and kind of... Now, question, how to estimate this one? This one. Okay, so, for example, let's say we have this data set, this is a label, it has set, we have refund, are you toysypus, taxable income, currently class, as in, okay? So now we have this history code. The phone is in the audio value for this random manual refund is no. The American status is divorced, and income is... Okay. So we need to estimate 1st this one, key of a, recourse to yes, human eggs. Okay. And also, we need to find this one, this probability of event product. class being no or even being no, given if You know, the features. Right? But for the simplicity, from now on, we just replace the event equals 2 years. I've been able to, you know, it, it, it, because you said, you know, okay. So we should find these probability. Beijing, classification algorithms, we are trying to find these kinds of problems. Okay. So, now, how to estimate these new programming is, how to, so... You need its base story. So, this problem, K of, yes, even, exactly, of no given eggs, would be converted to these two. Okay? P of X, even, yes, P of 5, P of years. of eggs. And similarly, PFX, given no, it ties pure glow, do not fly, you know. Now the question. Here, is PF 8 important or not? Is it important for normal what is regular appeal case here? So, we want to compare at the end, we want to compare these 2 probabilities. Okay, please, 2 programmerties, P of U is given, HP of no learning, thanks. Okay. So, the CSPD denominator for these 2 are the same. So, we can just... um, this is... Now, how to simulate fear of extraneous, fear of X, given. Is it clear? Why we don't need to worry about the pure fix? Okay. So before we move to how to estimate these two, then they find a concept, conditional, independence. You say, two events, two, you have to run, variables or two, even speaks and why are conditionally independent, conditionally independent, given that, even that, if key of X, given Y is it, equals to pure X, given that, okay? Just right now. Let's say our length, and reading, saying these 2 are conditionally independent in this scenario, in this. Say, young child has shorter artists, and you need to hit reading scheme, compared to the others. Right? Okay. So we have a omelet, I'm reading this here. Right? If we, if we neglect this eight parameter here, if we fix it, don't consider it, okay? So is there any relation between the ardent and skill, reading skills? No, there is no occasion. But if we consider, as I said, for example, in this scenery, if we consider the age... So, there is some kind of relation, they can be made it up to each other. Right? The same conditional, independence. So you say, are not have reading is here unconditionally independent, even age. Now, back to our question, how to estimate this key of X given? Yes, and P of X given No. Videos, we naive version of the Asian, to that suppliers, or Asian, justification. So, why we say it's nice? Because we, so independency, it will be features, different features in our feature sets, our... So, things that we assume that we assume that there is no relation between X one and X two. There is no relation between extual and extreme. There is no relation between X one XT. So all the... features are easily independent of other features. So then, in that case, we can write these firm, these probability as this in this point. He of exploding to a trophy, given one day, James, the class, yes. A plus, is A plus. Would be equal to PFX one? Given YJ times P of H2. Even what J time, P of Extreme, even what J, of 2, P of XD. Given, eight, forgiven what we... But now one of these probilities can be a new fund. Just looking at the our data. Okay. So, our training, it has it, so just looking at each one. We can find the probability of PFDs given one. Wow. If you want to find the cure, Refund... equals to... no... even... even a course we get. How you would find it. Yes, right, right. So, you need to, since it's given, even it equals to, yes, so it feels that you only didn't have to look at this. E 8 equals to, yes. How many have one two and three. We have three. And among those 3 samples, which evades, even they trust is, yes, how many of them, for how many of them lay on in, no? One, two, three, three, three, yes. See, no, we knows, Portuguese. So much. 3 div One, one, one, one. And similarly, you can find for this one for NFA, it goes to, yes. years. What is the this one? How many How many? You know, how many samples we have in 3 equals to yes? Three, three, okay. And one of them, the refund for one of them were for one. So there is nothing for you. Okay. Okay. Here, is there any...? Compare the class colour. Maybe all the, yeah, you can relate it. The one half in the days where there is... No, there is the peasant extreme or... So, this is the assumption that we gave. So, because of the, my phone, um... We called him, Miss Hood, as name... Classifier, or name, please. But in reality, in reality, no, I would say, it's almost not possible to find, to, you know, to find me cases that the features are completely invested on each other. So, in fact, we are taking the wrong assumption in general. But it works. Interestingly, it's worse. one assumption. Oops. Okay, now, so now, the Newport is classified to YJ. So, you can, you know, you can... Unfor, let's say, send this or not to this, this policy to this. Okay. And if the right kids in this way, the new phone, it would be classified to working if these, right, will be maximum. But... What do you maximum... in each set? For which, values for all possible change, like, for all the scripture. 2 classes, one, one, two, if you have 3 classes, one, one, two, one, three, if you have 10 classes, one, one, two, one. Right. Okay. So, now... Yes, the pervious example, now, to find the, to classify this record, as part, because to know... The American statues include something worse, the income equals to 120 K. So we need to find 2 probabilities, P of X, given yes. Right? In general, we have to find the yes, given weeks. Right? Or no given case. using a knife classifier. So, it's for dinner later. this one. We'll find this, bro. Okay. So, we find, we have to find key of X given, yes, a few weeks given. No. And we have experience, we assume that there is no relation between and found, very consistent, and flexible, and so they are completely different. So we can write it. The 1st to pay off, refund is equals to no, high, even yes, time, pay off maritime status equals to yours, even, yes, time, pure income. equals to 120 days, even, yes, and similarly, for the, you know, as well. Right? Okay. So after finding this art, the only thing that we need from part to compare this, it's pure, yes, and pure, no. How we can't find it pure PS and pure snow. just okay, I' do we have? Yes. Tell some. how many of them are yes in 3 or 10. Brings your punchy, and say probability for PR. Yes. 0.7 or your VPR. No. Okay. So then free My most friend, PFS, by this one, and PF Nova, this one, and comparing the Aurora results. So, you can see... One reading class for this given? Yes, you with the vocals, you can do a lot. Yeah, because peer refund Yeah, so it was C. Let me see. So, for if, yeah, if that's one of the issues with the Beijing propagation, transitional version, if one of these probability, it goes to zero. So, oh, you know, the overall property would be, you know, so we have to, you know, Yeah, look, such... So, we, we, we, uh... current. So, then, I printed out, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, You know, one, three and zero, one, seven. And now, okay, so here, if you, it gets here, we have two types of events, one types of tea, right? Oh, I mean... Okay, what do you call that? Not a single, married, or years or no? Right. And otherwise, it kind of continues when the automatic, so for this one, you know that, okay, so the American status here can be one of these 3 or maybe, I don't know, some others. Okay, but it's limited. Right? It's a little bit more, a farm, can we, yes, or? No. No. Okay, so, but for the taxable income, it's unlimited, so you can just, okay, now let's count how many times we have no 95K. How many times you have, I don't know, 220 feet? Right? So we have to, you know, you know, these 2 types different, right? So, for the category called materials or features, it's very simple. PR picks, I, equals to C, n y, equally to NFC, and then for N. So, there's NFC here, as I say, here, for the kind of the number of times that it's time, because so, in a number of instances, how do you use the value XI equals to C? Sorry, specific, but for example, X, I, Refa, C? Yes, or no. Right? Belonging to class one. So, for example, Status... P. of Stategy goes to Mary, given no. Even though how many know we have, one, four, three, seven, okay? So in these 7, no, no samples, this samples from no classes, or how many of them, the American estators, of course, to married, or, right? So it doesn't be before over 7, oh, here, we found it close to, yes, human, brain class is of the outside city. Okay, so we have yes, yes, yes, here, and for both of them, the refund is no. So 10, 3 or 3 fall, we found equals to yes, given yes. Right? That's for... category coloured features. Now, for the Nomenical features, or continuous features. So we assume that, you know, the probability is followed in normal distribution. And we use this formula. Use this formula for each XIYR. P of XI, given by Jane Poison, is the J's class. Our ice picture. Okay, equals to one or... square root of 22 kind standard deviation to a cover of 2 times. E to the power of, you know, minus XI minus the meaning of 5G. Ice feature, in the... Plastic is working, when it has it is genes. Okay. So the number 2 divided by is the summer, efficient. So, for example, here, hey, let's appear, only in many countries that have been excellent. Right. Here, let's say, if you have to find a PF income, it goes to 120 K. Even? No. So, what should you do? Yeah, Chris, you need to buy the meat. Okay. And then the variance. Sorry, but... Yeah, right, sorry, maybe division. So if very. Okay, so that would be why. So what is stuff for me? Trust is known. And the class is not the same to me. Okay, they smell you. Right? Only for normal classes. Yes, yes for no. So we don't have PS. Just Nubarians would be, is for 15, just simply, you need to... This one. You have the XI 120, minus E, A, I don't know, because... So, you said, how many years you see? Okay, so that would be your income, income it goes to probability of the sample, main income is goes to 120 K, a forecast note. The class, no. So then similarly, you can do it, you can, you should repeat the same stuff for class, yes. and see which program is high. Would it just not be, maybe, you know, even in the life, maybe better just to stay in tax full income? To just say, yeah, yeah, okay, so, yeah. Another way, another way to near me, you know, this kind of numerical stuff. scripture in India. Or just let's say, 14 in a different way. And just... Similarly, similar to what we have done for the category in colour venues. That's another So let's have a look at this example. We have a chance record, reform, close to now, where it is set as close to New York, and income includes to 120 K. Right? So, we want to classify this record using 9 days, classic partner, or education. So we have to find over these program. Right? So we can't find them 3 or 3 or 3 probably close 2 years, given no. 3 or 7 POP because of it, based on his training. Here, we found people, so no, even, no, there is no... Here, for the close to years, they have, they have, and similar for the others as well. Then, for taxable income, for taxable income, again, you have to find a, you know, It whatever. can you close to 120. 120 K, when the class is no, and one more time when the class is, yes. No, this would be our P of X, even though you can write it as P of reform, it equals to no time based on its given train, given test, given test recording. Okay. So if your phone could be known here, right? Even now, I hear of yours, even now, how I pay of income equals to 120 K, even though that would be for this part. Then you have to do the similar compensation for any class, yes. PO free farm, it goes to no, given yes, I was POP yours, even is... Uh... No. After three, after we are done, these two, what should we do? Can you compare these two repeats? No, maybe need the They need to find PFNO, and PL, yes, as well. Okay, then multiply them by their corresponding probability. Okay, and... And seems to be of no human aches. Okay. this hard. It's either that POF is given drinks. Okay. And they say, okay, the class, the later, was a, you know, Any question? So if you have any classes, Yeah, so if you have 100 classes, if you have some 100 classes. Then you have to, you know, they take 100 times. Yes. For each. Is it clear? Please show tight enough reaction. Here's, like, 2 plus solutions, so you can easily compare between the SMM, but, but, plus, I mean, come up with the final suggestion. Yeah, so you need you need to develop material, the highest problem.. Yeah, the highest purpose. In this case, 'cause I was looking at it, you know, just really quickly. It seems that, for refund, no, an income around 90 K, it used to be that indicator four. We're notas there. Did this be not that, like, I feel like it kind of overwhelmed me, kind of... If you have a, if you have a, if you wear an outlier, where you have maybe some outlier, or maybe somebody say that, like, one of those, no single night you can produce, you know, like, 128 could be a lot of variance. Okay? And it would create the model worth able to properly it would be dragged all over out without is that a big issue? No. No, actually, I'm not sure that, you know, that can causer be issue here. Okay, since we are working the probability. Okay, so it's a big robot if you playersers. So it didn't take account, you know, the single values. And from, you know, each sample, it just takes over our promote. Yeah, so it can be considered kind of robustness of this algorithm, or the nose. So, a question, can we know the image classification? Do you name this classification, or classifier? We have an unique, let's just, let's say, we have, like, an escape. It can be fly... feature extraction just talking about the features selection. Yeah, so we already know the features. Yes, well, no, yes. I think yes. Yes, definitely, we can apply, or no, we know like the features are not independent. Okay? So, you see, the value for this, let's say, here, and here, or here and here are dependent. We are able. So if we have only eight, just assume that we have only 8 for 20 by 28 pictures. If you have 28 by 28, right, no variables. It is one, two, six, 28.28. Right. And each of these and animal venues can take a value. But it cannot like Okay. But since we already know that the, 1st of all, it's not. No, it means being high. Yeah, competition. it's very hard. So it's not fun. It doesn't make sense to apply in Asian classified, but we can. It can. You can't, you can apply it on any kind of classification task that you can find no kind of feature sets can be defined by the features of great.. As I say, We... We assume that... Should be a sum, we assume that there is no relationship between the different features. to the kind of around assumption. Okay. One of the... interesting properties of, you know, the 90 days or a period classifier is one. Cage that we can, even classify, is subcle, maybe partial information. So, it's not necessary to have access to all the values of the features or the features. So, for example, let's say, if we have here, a pregnancy, purely, opiores, and if you, if you, modelling your, these two pictures, they, they are as interesting. Or just maintenance. Just, just, we assume we have only one feature or two features. It's a tough, you know, right? In, you know, considering the income here, then, you just need like, Or if you only have the recount, okay, we just, we, like, the, well, you can, and taxable income. Okay. So, it means that, It means that, We can use this can I see for your classification algorithms. In cases that we have a very large amount of missing value. So, but, the question, with Persian information, the overall performance would be same as the, you know, the full information that's finished for informational food features. Definitely, no. So, we can classify, we can, we can classify you, we can classify, you know, the sample using one feature. It will get something. But the 2 features, 3 features, but definitely, Definitely the results with using, oh, the old features, it would be much more reliable than, you know, only using 2 features or one features. Right? So, airing absence some information about any attributes we can use, a priority, probabilities of class, like, also... Just, for example, let's say if we have only many, actually, we are the same, I... So... just if you have, let's say dep founding my st. Here, yes, given divorce. will be equals to Israel, key of divorce, given why, times, PR. Yes. Yes. right. And PF no, given yours, or my listeners, because to yours, will be close to PF relative status, it comes to errors, times PF no. Right? Or... If you have, if you only, if you only have 2 features. Refund, uh, many tourists. Is it clear? Any election? No sense. But now the question with what happens is the case when the SO had in a case of like Mari status divorced, both are not. Okay, so in the case of time, so in the case of time, for me, right? Okay, sometime for me is choose one of them, random. Yeah. It's classification. So give me a podcast, but they're like, well, hobbies, one thing, they're watching fantastic. But part of the, the places are not different, right? So how are you compare? Yeah, actually, so in that case, the only thing important for us is the value of this. one of them. a pictures the distance 100 p and another 2 fulate 10 Yeah. So, but you're comparing, like... Yeah, because we don't consider here, they know the relation. We assume that in any case, in any case, they are independent. So we don't know, we don't... We hear any information about their religion. Yes, you know, movie features. Study. Any question? Just...iz. Um, similarly, if you have, um, a chicken? And we can also... Seven. Go, go, go, go, go.. No question. Are you sure? Yes. Yes. Sometimes show kind of reaction. Because I believe that sometimes we should, we must be kind of difference between us and... Objects. No, no. I ask, show me reactions.. Now, the issue, I... So... maybe show that... about, you know, the zero property team. Okay. So, you know, in the case this here, let's say... If you have, if you have, let's say, 1000 or 100s of 1000 features, okay. So we have to compute the PFX one, given why, they don't PFX one, X two, given why, PFX up to 1000 per 100,000. But we have to find 100,000 probability. But if one of those probabilities, Take the value of 0, okay, every king would be zero. which doesn't make sense? Why it doesn't make sense? No, just keep to get, you know, the overall 0 probability. When only one of the features comes to probability 0. It can be, because it can be, for any reason, it can be a mistake. Okay, for that, for that feature to get that study. Right? So, We need to deal with these kind of problems as well. So, for example, here, many can switch to... Say, we're having one to classify this... record to this record. Okay. First of all, it's a partial. We have partial information, only in medical is supposed to be high. So you have to find here given by and here knows you like But for this one, it's been taken, you know. Do you want it? Yes. So is it a problem? So how can you read these kind of problems? So, or, let's say, assume that we have cut enough record life is. Is it enough inside? There any fun in, yes. this one and giving. So Spain is... That would cause to hear reform, it goes to yes, given, yes, for the yes, category of zero. Then he's married her, they met value for the medical, such as feature. Oh, 0 for this product. Okay, so for most of them, for most classes, yes and no, one of the probability would be zero. Right? Then it means that most of the probabilities... It's easy. Okay. So, this is one of the issue with the knife base.ifier for classification, I suppose. So, okay. Is it different than, you know, if you stay from ability, non-deal probability or having given people? Two, 0 is different than 2, 92, 90, 2, say, not 0 from a 50. That means that that single, actually, has classified the whole CPR issue, right? So you have 2 c. Yeah, but mean it's a kind of. So, okay, we said, okay, if we have, for example, if you have the value for the maintenance, it is a divorce, okay? So then it will, if we close to having 0 or 15, a number of just, no. So then we can say, okay, this sample, so the probability for being from just, no, is your activity, it's from just yet. It's a round assumption. Because this value, this value, can be, for any reason. So, you can be the most, for any reason, by mistake, or this... I don't know, anybody speak, can be, I said, look, so... So... What? I have to look at my answers, because... for what? Why is it, because you go... Because the one I don't invest with you... So you got it right there, because I got it right. Then what else I make? So, yes. Yes, okay. So, here is one, you... No, no, no. I could. And so, they just hear our assuming we are using before. We found this, and he was animated statuses. yours?. Okay. So here, we say, for people, if we just for class years. Okay, rainfall equals 2 yes. Very, very results here. Zero. Okay, so you have to plug it here. Then for the class, no, medical status equals to divorce, or class, no, V zero, okay? So here. Okay, in zero. Just, you know. We are Is it because it doesn't know someone can easier for both of them, right? For yes and Yeah, so definitely, you know. Because we don't have the attack in the, yeah, it's kind of easier for both. only to promot keep just looking at training. So based on training. Based on the condition that you got from the training data is okay, cannot classify this sample. None of those things Would be possible to just in case like it just ignore growilities of me That, that can be, that can be a one solution. okay? But there are some solutions that. Feel the thing. So, if one of the conditional programming is looking at the entire expression, you become the... ATUs, other estimates of condition for really bad, simple productions. in cases of s division. division. We need to have some others. So if origin of the original range of might be probability team, these kind of probabilities extended for to see, given what is, we have a number of types, then XI takes the value, see, per that's fine. Maybe class is, what? So it can be, So if the NFC, NFC equals to zero, the probability team would be... Okay. So... But today in Arabic, so can we really love to estimate? Similar to this one. Like, I think one, 2 day nominator. Okay. And I think we, the number of hospital venues that X can take. Now, if we would be a little number, one is also, political number, 18 and 0, it's, so then this would never, it's not the same. Just simply hear, for example, here, a set of, You know, okay, 0 by, let's say, you know, refund, yes. So it's a tough saying, okay, 0.3. You write 0 plus one Over, three. Three plus two. V number, the more possible values that the refund can take. So, it's just for categorical. Yes. So, So, it can be done. Yes, instead of having to be here, then it is really small value. I mean, one here, you can use the game very small by the Epsilo. Okay, I'm just, you can erect this wheat. We are more deep. options. Also, we have another way, and assuming, you say POP's eye, equals to C U and Y, for school, and of C plus, and P. Divideified N plus N end of C. in, you know, the number of the number of tons that the XI takes DC. When class label is was, and then is the old number of cases that are class label equals to what? Then P initial estimate. So it can be 18, then it, it's, It's your estimation, everything. Then, and then, when we have kind of hypercrowded. Question, what's the difference between parameters and hypercol? Difference between parameters, and hypercolt, in machine room, and deep learning, or specifically. So you are only dealing with these 2 herbs, parameters and hunter parameters. And imagine pro is just number people need like this amb which is in immediate value. Meanwhile, I think hyper primary, the kind of met, like they're almost meta, they're not about individual progress so much as the construction of the model you're trying to make. bi be for the size which for So in general. So, the difference between the higher parameters and parameters, you know, making me as a differenter or designer. We came in bad news for a... On the model, learn the values for the parameters by itself. For example, all the veins in neural networks are parameters, right? So during the training, your modelel event use the proper values for the meat. So they are perfect. current. All the bias, okay. But the hyper parameter, you give the value. For the, for example, in your network, when you say, okay, can you name some hypercratic neurotic? You're needing your love tree. So I'mters? It's that's... Number of bucks? Learning it. Foundation function. An extumation function. and see... Size of filters, and the size of filters, number of pictures. So the probability for dropout, right? We gain another important genes, I think, for example, loss function. type of loss function. right. Early stuffing. Yes, that is Is't it? choose if you want to have meat. Okay. just drop off. drop drop off percentage. So, you know, percentage, we mentioned, okay, then, the important ones, the, uh, mathematics that we're accuracies for, like matrics? No, it cannot be considered as a kind of, you know, hyper parameter, the metrics. So because you know for a specific test, you have to use some specific network. So you have to use those metrics. right? Religion size. Religion size.. Validation, they come, well, visually, the sun can be split, best place, be considered. Okay, that one, but still the important part of the meaning. Learning with mission. The number of layers, number of players, the number of number of neurons in each one. So they are also hyperference. You have to decide about that. So, then, let's say, can you have these data sets? Okay, and our interviews are... And these are other classes of having my mom and dad, not most, so... So... we have, just do it for yourself, please. for three minutes. So, we have this test record. So, the gear... It becomes we can fly, it goes to know... Using these data sets... No. Okay, Two calculation. It's really... makes sense or not. I know it's difficult to write, be good. Definitely. I like calculation. Definitely. Okay, so you need to find the PFA, the set of attendance. Okay, given F, uh, everyone, what time you need to find the PFA, one, and our number. Okay, so for PFA, given M, so you need to find PFM, give, give, give, give... And you can fly, PFM, you are living water, M, PFM, given... It's not lucky of M, you have legs, given M... Right? Then after that, you need to multiply these 2 by 3 of them I are spending some my ones I mean, you're a carpet. It's really just... I... He was... He was... I don't know, because mammals, buy it to all the astronauts, like, 20 ones, and it's a lot quicker, you wouldn't have to... Cain, if I had not. Yeah, so kind yeah. No, they might not. Questions, other question also. So here, in these states, I said, you see that if you have how many pictures, one, two, three, four, five. Why we use your furniture? hang on? Ignores in name is not important. Yeah. It's very religious. For some tests, for some tests, some features are not are left important, but for some other tests, the same features can be for them. For example, so here, you say the name is... not important. Right? But if you have another task, I don't have full practising gender. A name will be being made to each other. Right? So, these... stuff... Most important part, in machine learning, more specifically, in traditional machine learning. It is a feature engineering all this stuff to you know working with the future. Okay. September for everyone? Yeah. I put some... Okay, so... Okay. So, then, as a summary, in main base, algorithm reports to a 3 restaurant, so... And also, it's handled missing, but it's, like, Korean game style. You're in from our estimated connection. So, also, it's from us to everyone, a few goes, you know, so, redundant and donated. I think because you're boring trans traditional assumption. okay So if we have, you know, already done the, you know, our training set, so it will affect it probably. It can main be our motel with b for the you know those without the class of those developments. So also, if we say for the conditional assumption, every, okay, we said, okay, we assume that we assume that the only feature power is independent. But what if, and also, I mentioned, the single running assumption in Europe. But what if we have problems, and they explicitly say that, okay, these features are dependent to each other. So if the problem is something like that, so we cannot use, you know, the United ph classified. Can I say, okay, if you do, these features are dependent, but I assume that they are independent. Okay. For those cases, we use the Asian beef at first. Okay, but before diving into the Asian British effort, so now one question. How does my face perform on the power movie? Because if you have a data set, if you have these tested, like, okay, so we have 2 classes. bring suns from Kore blue one, right? And we want to apply 9 days classifier, how it can apply it. The probability of running new points would have been probably... Probably any point of having some kind of probability of that class being for the, so you mean using a pergus probability formula that you said, you know, a friend, and, uh, any other idea? 2 the ratio of like ratio like some point. So any other... So... As I mentioned, few seconds ago, if the problem, if the problem explicitly says that they, you know, the features are not independent. Okay, we cannot apply in any base as part. Here you see that There is a relevancy between the correlation between the features for different samples. Okay. So, for example, here, you see, okay, all red samples that are in this region, okay? The values are listed in this amount, and no name X one, because that's one of the extrude restaurants. All the samples, blue samples here in this region. Okay. It's very, it's one values are higher than this one, and this one is one and exclusing right from 7 more than people. So can condition here cannot 19, I remember, come on. So, in next movie, Pesian, Befnet, in question. For the last, like, introduce the wrong part, but, like, admiration would be an example, I think, talking to you. Yes, so you can can use deep from, you know, stuff. So, alright, what in terms of the building came was, SPM, you know, on Netflix, decision three. time use like point. But for me, since you can explicitly see here that there is independency, the independency between the features. So I thought of that. They cannot apply in my base classification algorithm here, but if you insist to apply, you can apply. But the results would not be different. So, now... Now, let's move into the Bijian belief network, so... The Bijian belief networks, or BBN? I mean, sure, it provides graphical representation of probabilistic relationship among a set of random variables. So if we have set of random variables like A, B, C, D, what do you think? So we assume that. It consists of, it directed a sickly graph of that. So, like, it's... There must be connection between nodes, and it directed connection. The direction must be also clearly, expressly, English. So, I know what corresponds to the variable. Our corresponds to the dependence relationship, dependency relationship between a period of variables. Then, a probability table, maybe we must help from ability tables. And consider that considered these dependencies as well. So, bring it up here. Let's say, and we said, D is a parent of C, A, A, is child of C, A, descendant of D. There is ancestral for... I know, in a Beijing network, it's conditionally independent of all of it, non descendants. Okay. If it's parents are... no. So, now, here, this is a Thai pal. It's for the 90 days assumption. We have this step. Okay? So they are independent. They So there is no indendency between. None of these, it's one from extreme, are dependent each other. Okay. Did promotion take here? FX does, FX does not have any patterns, they, like, for example, one, they don't have any pattern. Table contain prior probability, P of X. For... no pattern, we have POX. And it has only one current word. Okay. Table contains conditional probability, key of X, given Y as... FX has multiple patterns, like, for example, if you have here, then, W, whatever, and there was a, there were parts from the old, nodes to exit. Then... the table, contain condition, probability, PO X, UN, Y, Y, 2, Y, 3, Y, opt one. Okay, so now, just... We have something like, let's say, we have heart disease. Okay, it depends the probability of heart. Okay, having heart, is it? It depends of diet, I mean, diet, and also... So, also, we have chest pain at blood pressure. So the value of the blood pressure and having chest pain, they also are... If you have heart diseases, most probably you would have, it's a chest cream, and your blood pressure will be... Right? Now, this is our name... Okay, this is very similar to the entry, uh, uh, efficient fee, but you're taking a probably sort of entry rate. It's a similar structure. No, no, no, no, it's not trees. I know it's not a tree. It's just because the tree's a graph, but like, I would say, like, you are making it so that you're trying to find the highest quality athletes. No, no, no, we didn't feel anything about finding the proposity right now. just I'm explaining the of this program table. So, 1st up, in our case, this is our death. Okay, so it shows us the relation or dependency between different random variables. Okay. Our analytics are exercised, diet, hard, easy, and chess, and blood fresh. In this way, this city, you see that heart disease, diet, and exercise, and right, and doing exercise, can affect the heart disease. Right? And hard pieces can affect these two. Right? So, the problem, we assume that we have these programs, okay? The English side, so, they don't have a parent, so, just, uh, sit in these rooms. Exercise and night, they don't have parent, right? So, we are, we have here the prior, the only PF, exercise, free of diet. Okay, so we have exercise ones for years. for you know 0.7 0.3. It's based on the data system. Okay, pret 10 days. Okay, similarly here for diet, healthy diet, 25%, and unconsidered, 75%. Okay. Now, for the heart reason, Okay, so we said, okay. It should be conditional. It should be conditional. So, the... for heart disease, hard for heart, is a country. It should be condition on both of them, right, and exercise. If we have heart disease, okay, and the diet is healthy and exercise is, yes, I'm going to change, making, saying, oh, this is, could be this moment. Similarly, if the diabetes healthy and exercise is not, but just being heart disease, which is. If the diet is unhealthy, Yes. Heart disease, getting hard. This is a 55%. Unhealthy, no exercise. Send. 75%. Okay. Similarly, you have a fine for the this one. They study data suit. Okay. Now for here, for this one. We, we have to find the P of CP, given HD. Right? So, for CPA course 2, yeah, then HD, if you have chest, if you have heart pieces, okay? The probability of having chest pain would be 80%. If we don't have our diseases, the probability of having these things would be very low. And, scenario for this one, hot blood pressure. So I predicted the child based on the parents. Okay. So, is it... okay for everyone, how to interpret, you know, these tables, and, you know, these... network? The table comes from the network or the network? No, the tape? No. The table, the table, come from the data set. Okay. It comes from a data sip. But considering these relationships, but the relationships would just be given. Yes, yes, yes. Oh. So, like, we can construct any ground and then we would come up. No, no, no, no. We cannot concept things, okay? So, it's, it's, it's, it's given problem. Okay, so you have you are given a problem? Okay. Then, you know that, just by otherwise, they take no order, it's given. okay? So these are these kind of relation between different features or different types. I'm not thinking you could find, if they're in a case where you have 2 variables. Well, if you can test, you can say cold variants, or try to wear that. In between, whether it's specific. very. And then from there, maybe... I think the one I'm from. Yes, but usually, so it might take a regular afternoon. But usually, just... No. That's right, based on the artist, exactly. So you have, like, 2 that, 2 child, aside to parents, connecting one child? So what would you question? No, just assuming that we have this kind of information extracted from our changing stuff? And so we grow how to find these kind of probabilities from training, right? So you're similar to previous ones that we have done. Now, let's say if we have here given this record, sample test suffered, eggs. So, exercise, because to know... the various equals to US, chest pain, equals to US, frat, pressure, hot. Right. Now, we want to find it, probability take off. Okay. I mean, hard, this is considering those dependencies between, you know, between new valuables. So... No, we know that fear of heart disease... So, we know the fear of heart is, given eyes and fixer cells. Here, here, art, is it? It calls 2 years, when exercise, you know, I need, yes, is... Right? This one. Yeah. So, 8, 8... He is no. He is no. E no This should be 45. Yeah. Okay. Then... see... CPS... anticipating is... even heart is just yet... Hi, I'm not pressure, given a HD in. Yes? I blood pressure. Yes 185. Okay. Now, finally, we have to multiply the... Is the same, or similarly, we have to do for the... you know, heart, this is a constable, you know. Then we have to compare these two numbers, 0. 37. much higher than this one. would be classified. Okay. So... That's all about the million classifiers.
