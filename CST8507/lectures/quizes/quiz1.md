# NLP - Quiz 1

### Question 1

Which of the following best describes the relationship between AI, ML, DL, and NLP?

- A) DL and ML are unrelated to AI, while NLP is the main branch of AI.
- B) AI is a subset of DL, ML is a subset of DL, and NLP is subset of ML.
- C) AI is a subset of ML, ML is a subset of DL, and NLP is unrelated to these fields.
- D) NLP is a subset of AI focused on language tasks; ML is an approach to achieve AI; DL is a type of ML.

### Question 2

Which of the following is not an example of natural language generation?

- A) Converting speech to text
- B) Translating a document from English to French
- C) Writing a news article
- D) Text Classification

---

### Question 3

Variation in NLP is a challenge because language data is often highly skewed, with a few words being very frequent and a vast number of words occurring rarely.

- True
- False

---

### Question 4

AI aims to create systems that rely only on fixed rules and do not involve learning, while machine learning is an unrelated field that does not use data to make predictions.

- True
- False

---

### Question 5

A document is a raw or semi-structured piece of text (such as an article or report), whereas knowledge refers to structured, interpreted information such as facts, entities, or relationships extracted from documents.

- True
- False

---

### Question 6

The goal of NLP is to develop algorithms and models that can understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is useful and meaningful.

- True
- False

---

### Question 7

In the Alan Turing test, a human evaluator interacts through text with two unseen participants: one human and one machine. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell which one is the machine based on the conversation, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.

- True
- False

---

### Question 8

Text summarization is challenging because the system must select the most important information while maintaining coherence, context, and meaning from the original text. In text summarization, there is no need to maintain the overall meaning and coherence of the original text while extracting key information.

- True
- False

---

### Question 9

The main challenge in sentiment analysis lies in the complexity of human emotions and language, so it requires a deeper understanding of language and context.

- True
- False

---

### Question 10

Which deep learning architecture, introduced in 2017, demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks and marked a turning point in natural language understanding?

- A) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- B) Transformer
- C) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- D) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
