I wrote something in the flight space..HD in.. My BG in an image justation and noisy. was in software verification. My PSD wass in you mathem science. Yes. And after I finished mine, PHD, I five years later that I know that associated professor, a machine bl Bl. Okay, so. I have a couple of published to be bar and I go thank you, John, but I didn't publish shili paper, actually don't. He's a practical work. Pro. more experience in natural languageible system. I started course view, I str a long time to read. I think Facebook books, actually, so I had come.ommend successing. Then I started for both them up course outline, and I hope this sequence will be okay with you. So I never did the course based on, you know, two stages. In the first, they be four or five lectures, I started to devolve the idea, how will represent natural language processing or how we present a text in a form that a computer can understand? So all of us know that the computer understands only one man, which is zero one, okay? Now, for our numbers, you have experience with V, you know, you can represent the information in the table. So the number it's easy to understand the invol any machine. But what about the text? How would it present our natural language in a form is a computer can process and analyze what we can buildally application bas, okay? My way is to start this a process from the beginning to where theologist step. So starting from statistic techniques, she learning techniques, you andmit one you admit one, and then we come to the transport, which is up to date architecture to build any application, okay? So the festival lecture, I focus on the different ways and the method to represent any the in a form that the computer can understand. And then we go to more techniques for moderate this information, and then we end up with the transformer and larger language to modern, we'll have a good idea about it, larger language modelling, promet engineering. model compression, which is a new techniques now, they use different to compression technique to reduce the size of any larger language in modern to be easy to download it in your local computer and run lar larger language model in your computer. So this is a scenario of the whole course. For this lecture, I will start to always give you a vocview about the CSI and the ch to read the CSI. Okay? So I amommending that the both through the CI read it carefully, because this is about the policy and the strategy that we inform you in the course, okay? Some of these rules are represented him in the night, but others you can find it in the year. What are more information, actually? And then we, in this lecture, I'm not going to agypt technical details, I'm just telling you, I'm going to give you what is an action I which you're processing, what is application and what's the challenge? So in natural language? So we start to raise CSI contacting information. It is in the right space. You have two professors, two different lab professor. I know that all of you know Ali, because Ali is teach another course, but Abbas is a new one for you, but he taught much language and processing actually in summer while I was in my. So he also familiar with his language. Okay? So this is my contacting information, please, please. I have I'm teaching another course in a CP program. I have 110 students in this course. So please, when you send an email, include all this information. Your name, what is a course, and what is a section number, if it's related to a specific lab, okay? Right, so you can find it apply space, a contact information for your t app professor on the contacting information in the content of the bright space. This is evaluation program, okay? So as you see, it'svi into 50, 50, 50% practica, 50% for K, okay? For the practical, I have collapse, F, E holds. And then I have aign, oneign it to cover the first half of the semester, and then I have a room assigned at the end of the semester where you can work in, okay? And then we have the mid 10, 15, final exam 25%, and I have a participation. Okay, I will talk about every fight in the dense, but this is the overview of the evaluation break. Again, as a app, full laps, equities recrued every lab or 5%, the lab should be deep demonstrated. So when you finish the lab, you will demot this lab and you own lab section, okay? So where, as normal month, your lab professor will ask you some question related to your book. Assignments as I mentioned assignment one.. was probably that you of assignment one in or the beginning of week. It's an individual work, but assignment to it's a group work, I will publish assign to a week tonight, where in week seven, I will the group agrment, okay? So in a bright space, I will announce this, the brightest space, I will inform the group, and each student carry shows his partner in his book. I would not assign members for any. I open it with a unit, so if you deciding to work who specifically, so choose any group, and you have to en room yourself in this room. Okay? The submission will be a code report and presentation, Henry 12th. So the group are a whoops, Max. Two members. during the election at the same time of the election. It is only 60 minutes short, so we will take only one hour for the metre. The material cover in the metre, we come from starting from week 1 to week six. It's it's 15%, Low book, on paper, and I used in all my courses, playing your own. Okay? I find it it's very, very helpful for Mrs student. I don't want the student to memorize, okay? So anyone think that you don't want to memorize it, just write it in your, okay? So the same idea for the final exam, bring your own the same. Just one beer face, right, whatever you want. H printed, do whatever you want. So I just have one requirement to keep some space in the topft of the top corner of each side where you drop can side. Okay, so basically my experience in a way you driving it actually, not in your course. We find an instant self students have a month of chi cheat and then they swat it with them during. That's why I find the best way is to say that lets block the side in a stage so we can we can see that he was the same. Okay? Any question? Yes. It sounds the way an MCQ? All right. So for the meeting, I prefer to be execution. So, metre is execute, two, four jobs for the final is not, okay? The final, you will find some ready question, okay? But for the final metre, yes, it's a market question. choice and also, it's the English. Okay? Now, what about the participation agency in them imagulation breakdown participation was 10%. So I prefer to have somelexibility related to participation, so I will have a participation, we will tell you only five. Oh, see. All right, so... Okay, best the five. So I choose only test the five. So if I do, always a participation and I recommend it to do as the participation, always a participation, because the main objective of the participation to heat the students up to date is a course date. Okay? Because each participation is related to cove that previousadius lecture. So testing of knowledge in this lecture and also at the same kind, it gives you an idea, has a question for this part.. Not exactly as the same, but it gives you some. Okay? So this is a main purpose of the. And if he didn't, he the participation, you are not able to seize the questions and the answer. Because after the diet, I published that question and the answer. So if you didn't do your participation, you are not able to see a question on some of this participation. So please, my recommation is to go and finish all the partication. Okay? Theation blocked during your lecture. So usually, the last 10 minutes of the lecture, it is fourth of participation, which covered the previous section, the same day. Okay, so starting from week two, we'll have a participation at the end of the lecture, which you cover the material that we covered in week one, okay? It's an open book. for you, it's okay, we can use whatever resources you want, but I think I this is my condition here. attend this election, we will think about. If you didn't attend this election to locate what things about, okay? And I have my way to check the IP address it apply to space to make sure that all the students who will take so participation and then. Okay? Any question. Any problem with this? Is this okay? So for any reason, for any emergency, you are not able to be to participation is that you will not lose at 10%. So I will drop the lowest. Okay, fair enough. That. So,emb? I had the situation many times. I found that the student date of participation when they are not attendance a plus, there is an EI. Okay, so the lectureables, again, again, you time you can ask any question, during the lecture. No is very, very important in all my lectures. So as he knows the slide, it's just the headlines. But more explanation will be done with more the lectures. So I highly recommend they two try to take a notes yourect. Okay? Lab pools, as I mentioned that individual products should be individual work. discussion means that students if you research, in your life or us. I don't have any doc, okay? This is how actually we know. After the event, we learned from the others. We make a search, understand what happened, and then we develop our knowledge in our focus. This is a normal way to left. And I don't have any problem to lose this when you make your assignment or no left. So most of the time read the lab content hundred percent cover in the lecture, but for the assignment, 75% in the election, and it 25% in the your search. So it's part theertion is about the scale that you know. I have only one problem in this research. When you come to the den, and I ask you of the lap professor ask you some question related to your lap, you should be able to disappree. So pray whatever you want, but spend to some time to understand. This is how we learn and spend our language. But just grab something without eating breathing or able to explain it, what is going on here, This is not good, okay? So do whatever you want, but when it comes into the demo, please make sure that you are able to explain everything single point of your. Otherwise, as you know, means, okay? So this is the, any question. Now, of course, as I divided the evalination to 50/50 to have to drop 50% in practical world and 50% in theles. So waiting 50% in one field and less than 50% in the other will not pass. Okay? All right. importantformation assignment, okay. So I think this is related to the other, you know, the idea, if you know messed the dem, you would go. without any acceptable reason. And you have to send it to your lab protest, okay? So add this ringing for them, you have to attend the. I designed all the map in a way that for each nap, you have a week to discuss the lab with your lab office. So no tendo for this week. So once I publish, then there is a week that you can come to the lab and ask you nessor the discuss if you or anything is not feeling, show him his work, you can discuss it with your lab office. And after you submit the lab, you have to come at the demo. So I gave you for all the labs, a one week to three weeks so you can clim to the lab and the ostrof professor this. And then we can walk and soft. Right, so that the devo is not for evaluation. I have this strategy. It's a very spying, actually to have a lab professor in this course. Usually, I am on with the theory and the professor and the same time, while I like this event. Because I was quite interesting for 21 years and as you know, in university, you have a professor at Germany have a Airapse. But when I joined here, I run from college, I find it's completely different. So I like this monology, so for me, the devo is not more evaluation. So demo means just to asking questions. But later on, now we want the land and the checks the requirement, the next night, he was satisfied are required. So Sam students to come and say,Okay, I would everything was fine during the day. This is not in. The devil is just for asking questions, make sure that you, I want to buy yourself." And then after that, the professor would not know the lab and started the evaluatorsly. Okay? Uh, you select something that not match what you submitted, but not right to spism zero. This sometimes happens. What years of course, always in other courses, so that you need is on Sunday, for example, and I have a lab on Monday, another on Friday. So the sitting on Friday, okay? Say something else, and then we come Friday, everything was fine. And they did. But we not was much, they missed the all the day. We put mine, they is the all imagination. We normally not it and evaluate. So if you find some mistakes, something do't match what you demo, this is where there is something. So to make sure that to be there is. It's not fair that someone extra time to walk in this night, okay? The submission due there is a scene for old, right? Official submission deadline. It's in Friday night, and it's 1159 p.m. students, I allow all the students to sub on Sunday, was out in Plus, we have a late funality in our course, MCSI I think they have two days. We sleep in energy after Sunday, and after that, we don't see. So back to the CSI at the plant, okay? Any question? Sorry? I no extension or any submission for assigning to, because it. Okay? So he will submit assigning to at the beginning or someday on 13th and we started in mix 13 and week 14 to. So don't expect the names. I don't respond to any extension for Sp. Hybrid work, so this course has one hour hybrid. You will publish the content of the hyrid work week by week, and it is apart of your cost. Okay? So let me find some question in the participation related to the hyd. Okay? I'm trying to be reasonable as much as I can and one hour, how much I can work and publish, but make sure that it's so hard for your boss, okay? Next book, I have a text book. Actually, this is more plastical to maybe you are the introduction how to sp.. But the main one is the first one, is a one wine I find it on online water. and you find it online. So it's a source We all the thought actually, but if I have another resources, I will publish in the practiceices for each week, if I cover a specific copy from the book, I will mention that in that reading part. So I will tell you each chapter whatever interest. Or if I rely on other resources, I will tell you a link for these resources. Okay? Any question? All right, so that or pull up, pay free to use any one of this. I think is a notebook and the cool app, it's fair enough to work on this house as a piece. All of yes. You know an. Okay, perfect. Prerequisite of this course, as you know, the prerequisite, the merely requisite of any love and two. Courses is a machine learning course, okay? And then knowledge in my course. So you all the implementation would be done in place. So I expected that for the students, know Pison in a good leg. Okay? So this is a prerequisite called discourse. Right, so we say is the first part of our lesson agenda, he any question a CSI of course policy, any anythingitation on. Okay? The five, theth, again, move back and BTSI 10. okay? Now when we talk about, the second part of our lesson agenda, which is, what is a natural language of process. Does anyone have an experience, that experience with our natural language processing? Any experience You to engram? Anygram, yeah. a bag of words? This is a very simple. Yes. You have an experience? I. Okay. It is the morning.ically. Any other knowledge? Okay, so we talk about what is a natural language processing. So, in my opinion, what is an action member processing? As you see in this is my two, and right in the left hand, the side here, we have a huge source of t in our world. This t has come from books, articles, news, or even websites, okay? So we call it document. So somebody we call any source of NLP tech is a document. So this document have a specific characteristics. I in instruction. So we have structural representation and un destruction representation. And this is a mainly challenge of dealing with the text. The tech is to when it is unstructed, okay? Smokes, artic, there is no structure here. Ambiguous, the name characteristic of any, natural language, English English, French, Arabic, Chinese, al language, is ambitious, and I will show you what. And lots and the loto will have huge source of this capage. And in the other side, we have the knowledge. What do we need by knowledge of this language? What is the knowledge presentation? Can you have the definition of what is the knowledge presentation? You have a force of information with patient. Yes.. set up, rules and, the programmer set, the wall, and the machine figures out the plant trans to get. Okay. Yeah, so it's very good., yes? No, the world that are then interpreted by a machine to be able to act in the world. So all the purpose of knowledge that we know the structured in the brain, and that that user we can be able to ask this from that knowledge. So here that knowledge you presentation is to represent, okay? Any net in a form that the computer can understand. This is the name objective that the knowledge is in. It can be in a neighbourhood, like, can logic like you in, okay? So it's a four leng way, to represent M structured data. Okay, in a form is that the computer pan understand and work on a dog. So this is the knowledge and this is specific characteristic of any knowledge. It is a structured, this is a real objective, precise, actionable, we can get, belt, many application burnt, and specific to theop is on the taskruction unit in a specific point. Okay? Now, what is the rule of NLE? NLP and my income invest to convert? This instruction, information document to knowledge that we can use it to build a definite Mity application. So the main characteristic is for the documents, human can read, but there is slowly. We cannot memorize it to read it very slowly, but represent it in an knowledge for map, for knowledge representation for life, it will be fast, easy to find the information and open these characteristic of the former representation to any p at all. Okay? So this is the rule of any. How do we compare our lock? different to command from different resources, our restructure to something that can be beed., then our application on the top an instruction. Okay. Now the formal definition of natural language processing, there is many, many formal definition. If you open any book, you will find each author that define a natural ambition processing in a different way. But I like actually this, this definition. It's a sub field of linguistic. We use a language. It's a natural language. So in linguistics are very important to in our world. And computer science and artificial intage, with the main objective is, is to analyze and understand the human. Okay? So how to problem computer process toalyze large number of natural language data. So this is a metic definition of a mean definition of what is a natural language processing. Okay? Right. So what isation? My beh have natural manageable system. One, you use natural processing. And why it is important spec now. So starting in 2017. So every state, so application, for every recept. you make a research starting for 2017 till now, how much paper published in this year. Okay? If you compare it with another feat, okay, you will find MB, is a top. So what's our modification? Our motivation is to understand and process human language. One, we can learn many application if we understand is a language. translation, we can translate if you understand is a language. We can then take a summarization. We can count the many many application if we able to understand analyze a human language. And also industry in a area, using an energy application, they are now easy to analyize the feedback of the customers and improve they' sell this based on that customerers feedback. So it has many applications also in the business area. And this is very important. Now, any people with arity will easily can contact the visible. So by the horse. Any single related to the speech, is related to it's NP head under knees on this. Okay? And it's computer access information, it's left site and it makes sense for data from data, the common application unit is sentimental analysis. We have a huge amount of data in a social media. X, which is way before. Facebook, and number of social, how we can find the train in this social media, how we can find the feedback of the people according a specific for social media, as you see, it's this application actually pop up during the election, only when the election is based on how the people spoke in that social age. mean, you often make the miracle variable based on the new, like age or sex or name. And I'm going to give you what is the number or character, you that with a test. You can do anything. It will be beautiful in in. Yeah, when you I'm happy. But you don't know language. But I think one of the people processing the clean in your machine learning is to convert cate. To make it we need to know which money, which variable is this. You can do very easily. No, no, I mean you, just conver to white, like, notap is going to be as that maybe like a longer be. Okay, okay. be useful. Yes, it's it's a 5 to make it system exact automatically and it Dubai. It's the it's, yeah. Right? So this is part of theation we have really made mutivation to learn natural language processing, career opportunity. Now, there's a high demand of the people who understand the natural language for Ci is the increase use of larger language modelling the heat, people who understand what is a natural language process, okay? Right, so this is a sympate discussion activity. I invite you to go to Sailu Woodc and you can join with taking in the picture of the QR or just try the ID of the slidel and just it all give me some information about. Oh, I have it. So when you finish it, let me. So go to the the come and you can enter the number. This is the hero. Anyone moving? Anything is okay?. Yes, it's what is a difference between? AI and L. Okay. Okay. Are you okay? Is you? It's first time.. He doesn't. So machine gun pizza formation of FI. And. So I agree with most of you that you find that the difference between AI and the machine is learning. So is out. a human. Okay, so it's not a foundation, it's not that is okay, so I believe of the definition here where EI is the am that includes machine learning and many other food. So energy possessing is speech recognition, computer vis. All this application will be under the umbrella of here. The g definition of AI, it is just how to make a computer act like a AO is a behaviour of. When you ask a very small child to get something from the Braen, this is an intellment. This is a human intellig. How to make the computer m exist behaviour, this is what we going. What do you mean? To make the human, the machine imitate or simulate the human behaviour, okay? And the machine learning is a sub field of AO. where we let the computer learn the food it. We used a longer time before to write a program to give a computer instruction, okay? Why amm using machine learning there is no problem, just defeat that the computer with the in. And the computer understand or learn from this data and try to use any machine learning task, classification, plusering forecasting, what is the other task? Out association? Outliers. Anomalies. what is the name? Something we it association. Alright, so this is I think we can find it in the association? In the week, the main in the tab, on the weekend, use a ve application, yes. So you can find this main task. This is the main task of the machine, okay? One of them is sunset association. What is this? Did you find it? I cannot do you, but this is an Sorry? D analysis.is, but it has moved in something association. Relation association, something like that. All right, so? I need to check. association between the elements I know the application is this element, you know when you go to the supermarket, the they can offer in two different items, okay? So they learn it from it that if you put this item with this item with the same w. Okay, so this is the idea behind this, okay? how they use it in they make an offer. All right, so, yeah, most of your definition is correct. and I' All right. Thank you for your participation. Yeah, this is a big definition, this is a main definition between artificial intelligence and machineila.. So now, what is a relation between this terminocch? AI, artific invention, machine learninging MM BLG Late and MKG, process. Okay, so this is the relation. as I mentioned AIs and I' fair enough for all the application related to televisionvisions, how to the computer, television, and then as you see, we have here machine learning. And as a subset of the machine learning is a der. So deep learning is the same task white machine learning, and instead of using the normal machine learning techniques, we use deep, neural. Okay, so that's why deep learning is a subset of machine. And then we have a natural language of processing. As you see, it's interact with the machine learning and dig deep learning as natural language of processing use. All the machine learning techniques and deep learning techniques, okay? So the idea is, so in a machine learning, what is the formatography of this? You to have to create. as an eme. and this table have some eence, which one is, and here in the colum. or features. So I use or features. So we have, and then and the end you have, the decision or we call itcl. Okay? So raise on the values of this attribute, we can have ancient class based on your application, okay? And the usual. This information is allowance, okay? And believe it if you have a categ of data as a prerocessing instead, you have to convert it to numbers. Why it was a computer and understand, okay? We will do the same. Okay? We will convert to the takeest in the seed for metal. And this is the big processing of any text. How to convert that t is to form my los. There is many, many things who can have a dist and at the end, we have a day for this. And then we can my any machine learning technique based on this statement, or deep learning. So our repossessing when focussed on how we represent in a form of numbers. Okay? And then once we have a tableless number, now it will be ready for any applying anyiver and energy learning techniques. That's why here, large LB as an interaction with machine learning and deep. Now, andD, it's a smoked, just bo more, that is a long pastry when that I just started to come and then. So the start idea in machine and natural language to process it, process it in my, where they have a very simple transcellation machine. They call it a time, I think from. They started to have a very simple, very limited translation machine. And in 1960, the fairest child, very samped child, if you make herself about it's they call it., or something like that. Mary sent shot b on using FZen So it's a rule based sh, okay? And then actually, the main advance it off the second min is sten actually in 1970, where we started to use a statistical models to represent the. And then while there is an improvement or in machine learning techniques, the next step is how to use this machine techniques as a porto machine, decision in natural process. and enhance this application. In my opinion, the main step, actually, it is. In 2010. When G theward come, okay? So makes a lot of difference, an enhancement of MLP application. And the biggest is step in 2017 when the research, published the very famous paper, what is the paper name? Attention, all you need. Attention is all you need. Very famous thing. and starting from this. This is a year off larger language, because a few days, a few years after, we hear first time about shed, then in a top of the idea of the transport. Transformer is a building block for all modern and application. So it is a basic ad. And then they updated, developed it in a different format, it spelled the one that transformer. So that transformer transformer, transformer. changes again. Completely changes again. Okay, So, this is a very, very big step, because all upcoming applications developed on this the same item that transform. The transformal appitecture. It was a different form in Codod, Dod only, inod only. This is all large language more than built in a book. So this is a free pastestryla an enemy. Before we talk aboutation moveity, is a very famous test in our field, a language process. So this test divided in 1915 by I think a British scientist called Alan T. He invited this and this test now is considered as a pm for all AI application. Okay? Still now. It's used. So what is the idea of this test? We have three components in this test. We have a judge, or evaluator, a human, okay? And then we have a computer system, and we have another unit, okay? Now, the idea is the judge ask a question. The judge not able to see who is a computer and who is a, okay? But the idea he ask a question, and p the computer and the human answers this question. If the judge, are able to differentiate, which uns come from the computer and which answer come from the human, the application will not boss the Alan test. But if that judge I' not able to differentiate, which answer come from which, in this case, the machine the computer system or EI system plus the. So it's used in the EI application and it's common in to use also in an language. Okay, if this, now application of natural language process, in application, then you give the example of an application? Sorry?ation course, yes. Where? Where Forensics.. For thection, yes, okay? Yes, okay? Any other application? Something that you to remove your name. spam picture. Span, or not a span. This is a machine, this is natural damage process. Your own iPhone.. language processing.. When you write something, okay, when you write a name, It's a national process, okay? So we have an application of language processing in all our okay? So one go to the comment application of natural language processing, before I took and how about application, I want to differentiate between that application. So if you divide the natural processing the application, we can see that it's divided into million in part, or categories. The one is natural language understanding, and the second one is natural languageation. Okay? So some application that use only natural language understanding. Some application based on natural language generation. application combined most understanding, and then generate a text. Okay? So, for example, pure and natural language to understand. Can you give me an application that you in only understanding is a fixed. S? I not to be able to understand sentiments, sentiment. Sentiment.? Yes, it's it's I understanding, but it's clean, a deep understanding. Translate. Sorry,ation. understanding and generation. Because when you, you understand is a source, and then you generate thealment, yes? Classification.. It is the classification, okay? Spam or not span in low key. It's a classification. It's based on understanding of we can classify the text, okay? And Another example of natural language generation, like your clique transation, in another example. All the analogue Sorry? The. That's a. Yeah, it's generation, any other application.mariation. I understand is that, then generate a summary of the states, okay? So this is a different type of natural language generation. A pure natural language generation. Just to gener the language. Can you think about an application that just natural language language, no understanding? Speech to texts, for text to speech. Did you have to understand? Well, it Speech too? text. Okay, yes, maybe this is a generation, yes. There's no understanding they cut. I have an example, they try to understand this signals, then convert this a signal toward, then combine the word to general text. Yes, okay. Another application. Any reporting generation come from this, natural language generation. Okay, so for example, American report, automatic medical report is generation. We have some features related to Zuser. measurement, analysis, and then automaticallyase on this information, the automatic elation rates are. Okay? So always are report any report to this data, then it is a natural language. But most of the modern application actually combine natural language understanding and the natural knowledge Jewish. So that of application of amity, why it is not a few MNP NB, but NLP play a very important rule in a speech of system. So a speech recognition system, theput is a wise, and then we converted this voice into. into text. Okay? So it's a propation of different nense and. So there is an image processing our signal, processing here, because you have a speech, as a signal, signal processing here, play a very important tool, how to devoid the voice into signal. And we have acoustic system to to convert these signals to characters or word soldiers, acoustic mode in here, and then we hear an MLP to convert this and to a text. OK? So it is not a pure MLP, but MMP, it's an important part. Give me an example, like auto translation in I. Okay, so how does it generate to translation? in the books, okay? So if they use this system in autorans. And also we have another application conversation agent and chat. We have speaking chapot or transcript, where the computer can answer some questions from the user zone. use this shot in customer service and technical. When you try to make a conversation in Amy and Rosa or something, you will reply to you. to just. Okay, so they use his ear is a speech and recognition. It's a speech, like Alexa, for example, for Siri, take at a speech and then there is a language understanding to understand it is part of speech recognition to convert a language and then their response and then they leave the opposite of the speech recognition. How to convert the fact is the words, okay? So as you see here, it's a part of many, many techniques here, one of theniques, you have to have a di, which is just the key track of the same called test using the conversation and the control the low between question and the answer. So it's a very complicated system, but natural language processing today and important to reward basis. So it's invalid in these systems. Another application, which is more natural language in processing is class, and we have many application of classification. evening, sp or not. Language detection. I can feed the computer which a specific language form text form, Daniel language, then it can predict this is for any language, more than detection. So I have our. Yeah, our documented detection paragraph detection where you can see the computer with, then he can classify if it's a use, it's a sport, it's a b or whatever. So there is many, many application in the classification. And we have this is a very important application sy in the all. Sometimes people mix in green classation and sentimental, but actually, there's a huge difference. And I think it's a classification you need to understand or shadow, understand all the language. Usually, how the thing is classification work. They try to find a specific word in the Test and then based on this word classify theest as spam or not a spam, for example. Okay? So it doesn't need a deep understanding authentics, but in this sentimental analysis, we need a very deep understanding of the text, because we not classify the text. We try to find the emotion behind the text. The attitude behind the text. the difference between between classification and supplemental analysis, it's the deep understanding oftics because we need to cl to extract insight, train, promotion, attitudes, okay? But again, it is a very important application of natural manage processing. biggest summarization. So take a summarization. Ah, I forgot to ask you. Okay, so you could prefer to have a 10 minute in the medal or we can finish 10 minutes every week. 10 minutes. All right. So starting from next lecture. We start at 2, So officially, we have two C fit. Yes. And so extracted a because we not take a break and then another 10 minutes for exercise for participation. So we have finish at. What? So our election will be finished at 3:30 and then we'll take 10 minutes to finish the participation, so we finish as. Okay.. Okay. So, the other important is mine.. The other important application is a take summarization, where you have a tickets and then your computer system summarize. This tech is in a short text. Actually, take a summarization one of the hardest NLP application. It does not use as a. As you think. Because there's many challenges in the case someization. how this is that important information? How to make the produced or the summary is a coherent. The word is called the phrase is connected to each of us. It's not. And dealing with a multip challenges in getting for any source that you want summarize. For example, summarizing an article or an o. It's not like summarizing researchoping. Derent. Derent, okay? So a lot of the challenges, cleaninging is redundance. So in some sources of articance or any moving or box, in some more, have we can get right consisted on. The complex. Some are cric and the king, some have many idea behind. How to find a way to deal with this complexity of any effect. The other problem is after you try to solve all this problem and you got to was a very good summarization system, you cannot apply it in any lunch. So if you can create a summarization system for English language, it's not easy to apply the same for French language. There is no one to one correspondence between different natural language. Okay? So after, there is no way to have a generic summarization between that it will be applied to any p. You have to reconstruct it from search. So a lot of the challenges in the summarization. Question answer? Why most probably question answering will be the topic of your project I used to learn Qu answer where you ask me to the question and the answer. Maybe, many question answer. So the two common technique is etcet, Exetractive, question answering where we will have a text, and we have a question, we just extract them correct the answer from your inbook text, just extraction. Search where to start and what is the N, and that is that extractive question answer. And in the other side, we have a generative question answer system, where you generate the answer, okay? using of course, a different So we cover cushion anring system more actually more our course. All right, Sh GBT. It's one of application for. Of course, it's in reinforcement, landing inside the architection of Chatty, but it is one of the application of enemy. It's a justification. You ask any larger language more than a question and it is on your tickets you generate the other. So it's also part of NNP application. Okay, any questions about? Is okay? Great, so any of. It's not easy to application. There is a lot of the challenges, and all this is challenges come from the next, the challenges in any natural language itself. Okay? So all the natural language have made challenges. So make the computer understand is a language, it's not an easy us, okay? So what of these challenges is a ambiguity? All the national languages ambiguous. Award in we have different. I have a different is the one., the context. Yes. This is in more natural match, not an English or only in English, and many more. Old and lands are ambit. And thirsty variation and a common. I will talk about it each one in the other challenges, but I just the main challenges. So ambiguous we have many four of ambiguity. Wards have definitely. So for example, the word pass has two different. It may be referred to fish. Five to fish or it may referred to low frequency in a city. The world debanked, it may have two different unions. The size of the leet or the financial institution, like it. So ambiguity is a part of any language. So this is an example of ambiguity in any natural language, the world that they have different. Another form, aiguity, we call it anument and bigot. What do you mean by attachment andiguity? It's not from the sentence, which phrase or a word attached to a specific modified. So for example, look at thisus this ascendment. She saw the man with a telescope. So with a telescope. attached to the man or attached to so? So she saw the man with hair telescope, or she saw the man who hold his hairope. It's looking, how to make the. We can understand from the context, but how to make the computer. Under understand that is a big. It's a big, big challenge. Another type of ambiguity, we call a conference ambiguity, where we don't know which entity refers to a specific real war subject. So for example here, read the subjectence. She, my girlfriend, and I met my lawyer for a drink, but she became an end had to leave. So she referred to my girlfriend or to Z.s from thecendence. Is that clear? No, it's not clear. So this is one of the channels. When you be your LMAD application, you have to conce what is a challenge and find the way to solve it. Another challenge is spars tea, what we need by spars tea, and this is the topic of your U governmentan blood yesterday. You had an app.. I was I? Or it was Ali? Okay. It's a second. It's a party two of you on that, because I know the lab professor before the lecture. So I divided the the first. What is? Chose any text, any text. and sword is a leak, a wall on this text. Okay, so this world repeat of the fragency of this word, this number, and then then. Okay? So you'll find out that there is some words with which is high frequent, used can take, and some other is really used in this text. So this is part of your lap, get any tickets and then. So you have a frequency, and you have a. So the first one for example, a here may 1000, so its rank is one. The second 8,000, it has a rank. I sold. So what is a relation between frequency and? L. Cannesium or decasing proportion decreasing or decrease, or tendous. So when the ranking increase, the fr frequency increase or the frequency increase, the rank increase. So what's the type of? prop Inverse profession. Yes. So, this is what we call in. So break one seat isversible proportion to one over on. So when there is high frequency, there is no frank. When there is no frequency, there is a high rank. With the analysis, any text from any type, from any resource, in this book, is an open book, article book a news book, or a scientific research paper. They have the same pattern. Some war is repeated high, and some wes are very, very late. Mary, what is appropriate English? And why it is appropriate for its challenge. Think about which your machine learning, okay? So in a machine learning, you have a family. Okay? Again, withance and ethnic. Yes? When you'll find in the out that, this innocent just repeated one time. How you consider this instant? Just the one time, there is more pattern. How we consider that? Sorry? What is our saying? What is the definition of out? Oh, is own, is outlet. What is the definition of outlay? Something not habit, okay? All right, so in machine, you make a machine understand or out the pattern. When the wri repeated many times they come up with an idea, with this feature, this decision happens. Okay? Now, the edison just happened one point.. How are you gonna say it? How can I believe, okay? But in natural language processing, this r world is very important for the song, okay? And this is a challenge. Right, as you see, then from when he created his law, he find out that, so you can see one third of word repeated or has high frequency, and then we have the medal and then we have a dy, real world, which happens very low in your in your text. And this is most of the t experimentist the same chart, okay? So the problem is, some of these words may be very important to identify the type of the data to identify important information in the tist, there is important in summarization, why it's happening only.ation, fuzzy wood, fuzzy logic. It may be happening one time. But it's a very important. And this is the nature of any natural language, and this is a challenge in any natural language. Okay? Like, another challenge is aation.ation not between a different, natural language, but there is a variation inside the same language. Come, yes? So the variation come in many four. Vation within the same language, like. So for a huge area, so you country or we have this experience here in Canada or in your right home, there is different cities or different province. Where is a language ev from this part to this part. Is that true? Okay, so geographical variation. So why we took the same language, but from different area, they have a different language, a different word, different diagramrammar talking in different. So this is a type of a variation inside the language. and variation geographic variation, so Mexican variation, so depos have different sentence but have the same. So this is not type of variation. Another variation is sociate variation. When you talk to, it educated person, it's different for you broke away a very simple person. Even in your back, okay? This is a variation in language There is also a variation between Style, formal informant. When you write a letter when you talk with your friend, it's not the same word that you use when you talk your boss or professor for. Okay? So in formal langues an informal language and there is a formal language, and this is appliedation. Why in the same language, okay? Use a different terminology, different tools, okay? Generation variation, for a sem people like me, I can hear this, so the language that I am people talk now is completely different. It's completely different to use a new technology, new vocat, new way. Okay? So this is our generation. And variation between a different language language. What is a problem here? Because if you create an application work in perfect, in English language, you cannot take the same application under applied in a different language. It's not peaceful. It's not the same. You spend the time, money at the effort to create a perfect application. You cannot simply hate and applying to another language. You have to give a lot of other words. You can make, okay, so you can make sense to an effort take a benefit from the effort, but you have to start the work from scratching, because it's a different language. And this is actually a challenge for inhients, okay? And this is what he mean by variation, our variety as a challenge in natural language processing. The last challenge, yes. like a one language or analytic there is a one to one map in the vocab from one language or language. letters are worth more one we language. Yes, but again, it's strange. Because it' Now the challenge is a common note. So between the human, we have a common note. But how we can transf is common knowledge to the computer. Okay? So for example, it's a fair I actually need to shoot the. Okay, so I give theT my idea, I've alwaysied on the graphs. So if I have an idea, I want to represent, I always search, what is the best graph represent on my idea. So the first time actually to shoot use ShT to generate an image, I gave the BT, my idea, and I to this. And that actually, I think it's it's it's a good MG, it represent this idea. So as a human, a man, we have to sentence it, man with a dog or dog with a man, as a human, what is a common knowledge? Is a dog with a man? No, but a full computer, you don't know, this is a correct sentence structure everything. This is not a common knowledge in us, but how we convert all this common knowledge to computer, how make the computer understand is a common knowledge. Other common knowledge here, which he is else is round. The sun is hott. This is a common knowledge, okay? Everyone know that. And he can prevent of those power do you make common knowledge to the machine. This is another time of the challenge. And looking about other challenges, he's joining the slide room. with this called and there's more and more challenges. So please give me hand your second time what is the other challenges may be farmed in when you be able to your MMP. Did you join? Yeah, it's a long, okay. Volume. Okay, it's a the data. Vice. You train, country. Yes. Accent dealing to a slang, dealing with a different accent. Yeah, It's a challenge. Ah, yes, the point of it itself, yes, yes, it takes a long time and it's a hard. It's a hardest part of NLEP application.ation is the manarchy that, motionless. It was a blind musication. You mean a complex. Complex text, which accomp The dist is not assemble, it's lost a complex, and many ideas behind it. you can events to understand whatext, yes. L evolving of an en techniques, all these application improved. Look at the translation, 10 years ago before. And look at the translation. There is a huge important as a technology improved, a message improved the architect improved, also this application improved. Comp, tune. Yes, I agree, so the main challenge actually, as I tried to summarize here, the voice. and defence. It's a very important challenge. The computation resources, to where they any, you need a huge resources. resources, tie, power, human, so we need a computation, a huge computation resources. But anyone here mentioned security privacy? challenge you now? In name, our From the data. So even when you. youT your conversation to improve a. So it at a training. So security and privacy, it's a big now, what's so in man of the challenges actually in adversible, yes? Yeah. So security. Perfect. Perfect. This is a big challengees, actually. There many challenges now? So there is a lot, a lot of challenges in bing and MDP and you have to consider it when you burn your M energy. I have justified. All right, so how do we. G application. Now approach is to NLP to solve that application. parking for the early evening which we use? Here this? Reg separation will become a regular ex separation election? This is the a technique to can or the Korean a sand veil. is the regular separation and F. And then they come up with machine learning creeps. So they use, you can use machine that some more advanced technique, more than heuristic, based and. And then we have ajit learning, RN we have a Mazad version of RNN used in the natural language application, and we end up with a Trans and forward, architecture, which is a state of the art of technique. Please don't consider that the, no one. So for example in here, a haric peace and energy, which use a regular separation called F and, is a very old technique. Dio need to use it now. Actually, surprise me yes. I make a lot of investigation about a place, and I find out that even you can an LD application with a state of the artificnique and everything is fine. You still have some cases where your systems take on these cases. Whereas when you're running the system, putting the production, the system working very well, but it still filled in a specific cases. How do you do not this? You can hear the system from scratch? No, what they are doing, they plug in a very small rule, based the system to is this specific fake. A a small system to work with these specific a system ad. So still till now, they use this. So don't say that it's a model technique and no need to no one use it now. No, please still use it now. Some application application, nothing transform. You not transformer is good, but you need a sources to run the transform. Some application, just in need a cell machine taking, and it's successful. Okay, so it's based on the application, right? Okay? Right, any, the master thing we have a home might be I thinking is this in your bath. So some wiper is skin p that gave was MDP, the common ones can empty Stacey, hugging face, very important resource in our course. And, with acid technique, of course, but I think, will use it at the beginning for reprocessing, on how to convert clean your takes and then convert your tquets to table, so you can apply any d technique on this. Thank you so much for coming and for my lesson. I hope to see you next lecture. Any question. Yes. So nowadays we can a problem. Sorry, now you.. Sorry, now you can? problems software. Okay, so, stuff to use up the. You roll?.. Oh, Does she want to? I don't. You have the same? Yes.... Okay, never. Yeah, man.? The next class in CA. Next class. CA, the CA. No CA. Check in. one. When we had the class? Another one. Chicken. For the face. Simply that we had a class station. Yeah. So let's. Yeah, we have like. I don't. It's. After you the people are looking at, you, you.
