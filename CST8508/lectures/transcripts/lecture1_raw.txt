The rice of deeply. Maybe you'll get put that for your exam. Okay, so it's the rise of deep learning technique that brought in drastic change in the field of machine machine. Okay.. Now, let's take a look at the key technology. As I mentioned, there are mainly three steps. First one is major capturing. For capturing the image, we need some devices, right? So we can use cameraeras or sensors for this. And the popular or most commonly used to major sensors as CCV and CO, and these other ones, which is widely used in our cameras. So smartphone cameras, and these still cameras. All these use the CCD and C.? The image sensors is one of the kingdomology, and second step, you know, like, must be got the image by using the sensors. And second step is processing that image, right? For that we need some techniques. So that is a second technology, like image of processing techniques. An example, is faturing energy detection, which you are doing in your lab when of it. No, labon activity. So you are like doing some courses filters, like year after like can detection. All those things are technologies, that are used in machine machine. and the fibre war is a raw of machine regulation. Okay, Particularly, Team Play mentioned the key trading point is the deep learning. So all these technologies work together to enable machines, to understand visual data. Okay, so what are thement? sensors and processing techniques and machine learning, especially deep learning. All these technology say machine machine. So what are the application of fishing mission in everyday life? Please see machine machine everywhere, everyday, actually. From your cell phone, you are using the facial recognition to unlock your smart phone, right? So you are like dealing with machine machine technology every day, actually. But we can see in different fields or different space, how the fit. Every day, it's actually used for badboard, you know, like if you go to Walmart or any other supermarket. Like, you can pay by yourself by doing the badboard scaring, right? When you scan the badboard, if you got all the information is that. So that's one of the application of the machine. And it is also used for inventory management, for the employees, like with working as an inventory storekeeper, and they can keep track of the inventory stuff, like how many, like, you know, packets of milk is there. Like, if it is empty, the chefs are emptied, will alert them, hey, this shelf is MMD, just restock it. So all these are some of the application in the retailer. and in the manufacturing industry, as I mentioned earlier, it can be used for policics on the Asund line. So we have the device of Sidi conveyor belt that takes images of the products and then that can like do the processing and compare with the expected values and if it is not mating it. So we can say that the point is not good. And if it is meeting, they can pass. Right. So that's how we use machine mission in manufacturing. When other field is entertainment. There is no like a point of like explaining it further, because you know that in movies we see a lot of official effects these days. So that's a practical application of entertainment, not really that we have the awk reality for games and, you know, all these are simple examples in the entertainment. And automile industry, when you come to that, that's a big change, right? Now, we have like just last drive by. The cannot be like, this is not possible without machine mission, because of being each time the sensory change the image and processing and making decision rapidly, insteadally, right? So if some obstacle is there, it is not taking a momentary thing. It's just like apply the break at the moment, right? So machine mission is not a simple task or machine mission system is not a simple stuff because it needs quick decision making theacity, because some of the are life threatening systems that implements fac. So depending upon the criticality of the system, you need to choose, which is to use, which algorithm to use is, okay? Yeah. So that's how we seeobes it's also helping in l keeping cl sports, collection, and also for, you know, adaptive cis. All those are practical sandrus or practical artification of machine machine in automile. And you can think like how these technologies are helping out everyday life, right? Like making our life smoke easier everyday. So that's, if you can understand how muchness is important these days and what are they can happen for you, right? So these are some of the everyday life practical application, we can also take a look at one of the unpacked. So as we mentioned earlier, Achov was vehicles, we can use it for navigation, and in medical imaging. So in the healthcare industry, the machine missions is use even for diagnosing diseases. So we have the medical image scans, right? So from that scan, the system can even detect whether there is a tumour or any other, like fracture or stuff like that, right? So it can detect, and it can like suggest doctors, hey, this is like this is a symptoms of this kind of diseases. So it is used to even for diagnostics and surgicaly. So robotic surgeries are very common length these days. So those are very practical application of machine mission in advantles. Another one is facial recognition system that enhanced security, even in your mobile phones, not that even in airport security system can be used, a machine mission for, you know, the security purpose. Okay. So these are applications highlight the transmitting power of machine machine. And we have a single ass with more app conditions of machine machine and also like how we can do during COVID-19. So that's just a case study. But it's worth reading I' just like through it for you and that you can it like later. Every week I'll be uploading at 11th to that week. So you can't find it under a seamless material and application computation is not. So, what of the application is using mobile devices, using Face ID, mobile devices for unlocking error smart. And Another one is automated automobiles that we already discussed in Tesla they can sellly. And in angryriculture, even in agriculture, it is being used to using draws, they can watch they help. you know, there are compan that introduce to drones to help farmers to yeah, with a family. So you can bring through like how each field is making use of machine. Another one is in the health sector that you already discussed, which is like, you know, anari depiction or robotic surgery, et cetera. And then is e-commerce industry and I'm just naming these industries and you can b later and there's the case already about like how it has before during COVID-19. So in COVID-19, we had like access controlled to like supermarket, so like where we were in public spaces we had access controlrol-based or the machine machine system. I still remember like there are like some certain limit number of people, those can be inside the supermarket, so they have the count of people getting in and people leaving in. So if there is like person can be accommative, they tell like what person is allowed. So all these are achie fishing mission. And another ther fever detection camera, so there were light cameras that can sense your temperature and like you can save it 37 degrees sol or something, they can say hey, he has like ocean has a paper. So that is another application and social distancing detection. So there are like, you know, for social distancing detection also, we have used mission and for sanitizer prioritization, face masks, complaints. And if you are not like wearing face masks, you can detect from the camera. So all these fear, like some of the practical applications that was held during the com just case of like how should help in. Okay. Yeah, so, go through this document. Yeah, so the basic one of emission mission system. So as I mentioned earlier, there are three main stuff. So this is the backbone of the main concepts of mission mission. Okay, what flow can be summarized in just raised up First one is image, acquisition, second one is image processing, and third one is interpretation or action. So acquisition means acquiring the image all by capturing the image using some sensors or cameras. And immedi processing is where you do the analysis. We analyze and also we man play sometimes they captured image is not so good, like it's not clear, so you can apply something to make it more sharp and more like it to give more det details for televisionates, right. So the second step is the image processing is very important for machine mission. This is where we prepare our data. So we polish our, like we made data set to give us an input to the whatever. Okay, so this is the second step. And first step is interpretation or action. This is where your actual model is working. So we make a decision based on the data that we get from step two, which is processing. So for example, it's the same thing, like a addition it is in automated inspection system in manufacturing. As I mentioned here, there have been be used the systems in manufacturing for ensuring quality checks. Okay, so if you can imagine like in the first step we captured the bas some processing and then we become ready with the expectation and then we made a decision. So that's like you can relate how these steps are they usedision system. So we have an intervening to image processing, but we will learn the image processing and different techniques in detail from next class. So as an introduction to email to processing, say, it forms the core of the machine machine, so it's the heart of the machine machine without processing, the machine machine system cannot perform. So this is the core of machine machine, and you know that like a we have different formats for images today, also likeabi, and we have seen like converting from change to PNG or like from colour space, like through coloured image to gray scale. So these are all like, you know, different fore mats and different colour spaces, colour spaces, I think, but this is colour space, define how colour is represented. Okay, so all these are like we are dealing with different types of images, which means we have different types of condent for our data set. So we need to make it normalized or. Let's prepare the data set, right? For that we need is to make place. And I can show you that you get some of dollars maybe, like that you have already done in your love, but, you know and I have it just under the and under the l with the slides, we have this. So I have any m? Oh f Huski, and, I mean, as you know, we are using form of a lab activities because it's a tool that helps you to do some image manation. If that's not a tool for developing or training your model, but it's a tool for processing your image. Okay, so image processing, we can read the image, display the image, you change it into a different car space. We can do energy diction, we can do filtering by smoothing or sharpening or whatever like application which we want. So I'm just showing how to read an image and display. So we are recording the CB2 and since we cannot use CB2. for call because it doesn't have access to your system. Like, you know, your OS to operate proper window to display the image, we need to find a different way. So which is something what CB to underscore, I am show instead of Do Vegas und and we need to import that from this package google.collab.pches. So that's the function we use for displaying the image in Google call app and we are reading the image using the command CV2. IM read and we are printing the shape. So if you can see like if we print the shape, it returns the tap of. So image dot shape you. I like, you know, and the width and the number of China.. Okay, for, five is the I and 8. So, which means, like, the height of that image is 5 55 and the wind is 830 pixel and train channels are the, which is red green and blue. If it was like, you know, a gray scale image on a black white image, you know, like a qu between the output.. But you don't have anything, just. 55, 98 because there are no channels. So we have just another planet. So that's what image dot shake makes. And what does of image is doing? The print of image is just printing all the pixel array, right? It's anire. It's just like printing all the pixel values. So the first line shows 33, 3742, which shows the RGB value for the first. Okay, so likewise, you have a large number of like how many, you know, like, 55, frost and 832 quls. Such a big It's not recommended to break because it's around. But just for your information, so print of image just prints out the whole pixel all, which is in a. And finally, CV2. Sorry. That's a number of channels, like red, green, and blue. Sorry? That's a image doesn't. Archie? Yeah, I. Yeah, Greg has of 33, pizza from scale. And so for each colour, they say, like, this is the intensity of bread. Green Andrew. 33 for red, 37 14, 14 equals blue.. So that's the intensity of that colour in that. Okay. Yeah. So I'm finally, they you understand show me display the image. Okay, so like image. shape, image, and CB technically thought, I'm sure but from call with, I am sure.. Okay. So, let's see, like, what's a big self? You have an idea, like.. So, you know, like, what is a pixel now, right? An image comprises of a large number of pixels. which is a basic unit of image. So what is a basic unit image itself itself. So you can see in the first image that's a coloured image, which has, you can see like a black pixel, like that particular pixel is arming red, green, and blue intensity, which is on 29 for red. 49 for green and 88 for blue. which means the indensity of red, green and blue for that particular picture in the image. Okay. And the blue image, you can see it's a black and white image, so it has values fing 02. 0, and zero will be the black represent 250 brightest we have shades of grain So each pixel will show a cre any value to. It's say there are a single value, if there's a gray scale image. Our other, which it's a t of free values from the intensity of red and. Yeah, that's about the basics, right now we are like, in this course, actually, you've being started with a basic. advanced techniques like Nuralax. So you know, that like, as you mentioned the computer mission has come a long way since its beginning. The main reason is the evolution, like the advancement in the field of AI, especially neural networks. or deep planning technies. So the evolution of AI, especially deep learning has revolutionized machine machine. And because of AI, we get more ac systems, like the accuracy body impro, and therefore, in can and recognize complex patterns from images. If two, like objects are like occlude around like one object overlapping other, then our system was not able to off my jet curly, you think the neural networks in and can't be even identify the student objects or overlapping objects and stuff. So they basically basically it makes like can detect complex patterns from the images. So CNN is one of the like, you, the bad one for this initial like the sisters, and people be learning in just how CNN is like designed and how they are going to do it. So a CNL can actually like automatically do the feature extraction from the images. So that's why we say that Sents are the backwards for a mission mission system. So it do a lot of things b its's found. We don't have to like to do anything. So if we put a good image processor like polish images to the system, we can keep the results what you want. coming sessions, they will a deep dive into the CS of their architecture with power isving some of the mission mission problems and they are the application of the next. Yeah, but we get to get sticking to the Lora world. So CNN starts for a convional mural litre because it uses the mathematical operation. called converusion. Okay, and it's a class of the neural networks, and it is actually applying to analyzed fishy metic specific for emas. You have seen traditional artificial neural network, which can process, you, data, right? But this is like data in the form of li text or, you, other other format of data. But this is specifically for images or videos. CNS they are powerful for automated feature extraction in images, and people will see that in. And you can agree with this and they' train and order with a large number of data. So by data, I mean, like you just images is the data for data for neururals, like conditionitional neurolit. So when we trained up with a large dera set of, like, he makes of cats and heales of dogs. And when you give anput image, which let's say, I'm an image of a cat, tell that image going to like different layers, and finally gives me the output which is cat. Okay, if I input a dog, you should say, don't cat, or it's a dog. Okay, so that's how they knowural wants be how different. We give the importance, the input is being passed through different layers. And while it is being passed through through each layer, the system extracts some useful information and using all this information, they make some decision and say, hey, this is a Cation. But we will learn the architecture and all those stuff and let up coming. So what would be the carri opportunities for, you know, you in? Maybe, maybe you can be a machine engineer or a data scientist orer and tele special. So the machine mission engineer interface typically like designing and implementing machine mission system, and they, you know, the data scient is still basically like using the data, allow the data set, they convert they learn analyze it, they convert that d into, meaningful task information. And specialist is mainly for innovating new specialition technologies. so they need to find new alg the moral a new resribution technology this way. Okay, so these are the m potential roles, you can end up, if you are like focussing on mission mission, and industries are actively seeking for like those who have like expertising miss mission. technology because I have like totally like what are the daily life application, right? We have quite a large number ofations that we use facial missions. So we need more sophisticated systems, like, you know, more fast machines and like more relable solution for all of our problems. to make our lives more better. So there are quite a lot of their obviously more fishing miss.. So resources for Father Leni to deeply here understand some recommendended resources and this video is basically for, for. Yeah, so this one is basically for the animation and the ic work. In fact, it's a more. like it gives you a clear idea of like how different classification problems or object detection can be achieved as in CN. So you can actually are going to play now. So I'm just like making sure it's the CNN or the other. So that gives you an idea more like the house he. Yeah, let's be honest, Chari TB is also a good tune, like, you can't ask them to questions do like, for your class you now, and we'll be using higher opport C, I cancer floor, all these like technique and libraries for a discourse. And maybe we will be using opportunity and I torch, yeah, five torch. Yeah. That's these are sources.. Yeah, in the summer, it's like, we have gone through, what, the basics of machine machine. Yeah, as I mentioned, like there are female steps aquari, processing, making decisions, and the accom technology has evolved since like in invention of, you know, gaps devices. and one of the key technologies, sensors like the CO CCD these are the popular sensors and we have im major process techni like the filtering, like smoothing or like all those, like processing techniques and finally, we have some like machine learning techniques, especially the neural network of softty learning. Yeah, and we have also gone through railroad application, like in retail. We use it for back or scanning and you know, in auto mobile industry, we use it for latekeeping and obstacle detection and healthcare also like a weU. sorry, that's for advanced field, but for everyday, like we deal with like entertainment system and in advance, when you come to advanced, it is being used in healthcare for like, you know, for diagnostics and also for robotic surgeries and in automobile industry again for navigation. Yeah, and that's it for like today, that's the summary of today's class, so it's just like, you know, it's a broad field. It's not small. It's bigger than computer vision. Yeah, that's it for today. And next week, we will be learning more about the second step, which is the image for whatever fundamals of the major processing, what are some of the techniques that can be used for, major processing. That's sit for today, I' make early. crazy weather today. Yeah. Iuction and application of? Yes. Yes. Yes, for biometrical. Yes, because it's processing the, you know, anything the major side processing. manufacturing indust is mass. Every industry in need distribution to check the model. Otherwise, they'll lose the conference. Or you need the house, you, you know. take out many jobs from people, right? Otherwise, people can the quality. What about the Yeah, again. Yeah, but again, like, for accuracy and, you know, the better system. And also, I think they can also monitor because the better that actual, there is any problem with or bing machine that they can they can actually use the in the problems of planning, you know, like, you know rather than just. Yeah.. Stones? Dot? Yeah, yeah, that's what I meant. Like in agricultural in the streets used to call, you know, like for understanding the crops are ready for, you know, like picking out. And it can also like, you know, how to say like In the final stage, like they can sort out good ones from bad parts, like, you know, good apples for badasses everything can sing. Yeah, all sound like an application. is used to a decision it's like one of that is the. Yes.. But the problem is that meat. power. Correct. The power. That's the way So why we don't how many. Like I' saying, like, you are like, your main focus is like how to make, you know, that can work with this power. But you won without people. That should still be like, you know, last time you, as thousands of thousands. So it's the Lord of work, right? You don't have to reign by anything. Because it's only the breeding. Like, I show you, right? So if you breathe it, make it how big it is.. Just one. $200.'ve got some products miles from the machine. There's a me that mango criteri.
