do you know along with your and producer eleator. So the point you know who can depend upon you want your mechanism, how you are, how you created that knowledge base, what kind of veal embodyic you used, right? And how much is a chung size, what kind of chunking mechanism you used, right? And in the query, doesn't look like a good day. this case. This this is Yeah, so so we're talking about ourment generation, right? So the quality of the final output will depend upon how you created the knowledge base. What kind of retrieval you're doing, right? And so that quality you will retrieval. And of course, the quality of generation, right? How would you created the wrong, right? What model you' using for the generation? What temperature setting is you using, right? So it depends upon a lot of things, right? So you need to evaluate the system forestically. And you need to evaluate not just the output, right? You need to evaluate, particularly what happens is that when you develop some software applications in in your lab or in your R&D state, you are not worried about fairness, not other issues, right? You're not a about scalability. You're more worried about accuracy, right? And you tend to use some standard data reality, right? But real rate that can be messy, right? Real data cannot buyselves real data can be missing data, a lot of those games, okay? So there's a lot of bunch of reasons why you wanted to evaluate these, you know, generate applications, right? Forestically. So these are those those dimensions in which for the reasons you want to bealuated. So first of all, you want to evaluate, make sure that the output quality is good, what or metric you want to do, you know, measure in terms of some business metric, like your output, you know, the precision being record kind of metric. You want to make sure that the vari is high. Then you want to detect any bias and fairness issues associated with your LLs, okay? Then monitor. So this is in a way, this is also applicable to Micheellaneous systems, right? You are you are model of my might have some, you know, is there any model drift? For example, your data distribution might change. You're require a distribution might change. Input input distribution might change, right? And if not, you, give a caners. For example, your customer support agent, LL, right? People may start asking S something about some new product release in the market, right? And LRM has not knowledge about it because it's Ne is not trained on that data set, or we are not incorporated that knowledge into the knowledge base, right? That's like a data distribution change. They need to worry about, you, some kind of regulatory compliance. For example, people could accidentally, you know,, you, the personalally identifiable information, not other sensitive data into the front, right? And LL is not supposed to you know, use that, or LLM is not supposed to reveal any such information. right? So we need to So there's some strict, you know, regulatory compliance, yeah. a way to reverse if you the way that you give a prom, maybe to do some of how the p is written, someone could be able to you and you, yeah, those are. Is this possible in general, but you want that, so you do proper proper, the different they have different? Look? Yeah, yeah that the gate is the same one that the model is different. Some of the smart are able to just figure out what the difference are and tiny will get weak. Yeah, course, I remove that. So that's where you are.. So you not eliminate those kind of things, so you can only kind of migate some extent. Yeah, but that's that's an issue, that reverse engineering, the model reverse engineering, the training data is possible. People to. So once you know what model, you know how to do their break for that moment, right? So that's security issue, yes, that's true. Right. Support your military compliance, then you want to you want to improve your model, right? You need to do proper variations,less you know what's your current you know, you precision accuracy or your summarization quality, right? You couldn't improve that, right? And then you wanted to make sure that there there is Siri, people don't trust A, right? We start, directly giving A product to customers. They don't trust they. This build them they try using them why people started like in charge video because it started getting good answer, right? So people built us, they don't trust they want a system. So to build trust, you need to make sure that you know, it's producing good quality, right? Then, as I mentioned, usually you, when you develop any soware of research organ application, in the lab you test with some standard or benchmark request, which curated by your data sign, created by dominance experts, just tactics, right? But those are good quality data. All those data sets, the system may performed very well, but if you put that system, you know, into real world, right, then the results could be very different, right? So you need to measure what is the impact this model has on your words data, right? There of course, you wanted to prevent harmful outforts, right? the LR producing you know, like customer f particularly customer facing, right? If we started giving some, you, cardbirds to customers or started shouting at customerers into will not like it, right. So this odd bunch of and also finally, right when it comes to deployment, right? What kind of you know, what kind of infascentary need you need to use for the drawing this, right? For example, for latency, right? If a rag application is taking more than, you know, three seconds or five seconds, right, you brought people not like that. Or a customer support agent, taking more than one minute. They're not going to like that. Yeah. For preventing, are going to do LLM or should we do it with another software layer? They usually, what they do there be, you know, God rates. They put God r so they sanitize input, make sure the input doesn't have any queries related to that. then also some cases, even if you put that, it can pass through, right? Then output also you make sure that you're not producing anything. So there is a bunch of tens. Yeah, so of there is a gargling some place, but you are going to evaluate now, if the is working. So I'm talking about evaluation. So yeah, so are part of the system. Now you want to evaluate, make sure that it's what it's worth. That's right. Okay. So that's what I'm saying, just not you're not just testing the LR. You testing. Okay. So these are the reasons, you know, you wanted to evaluate, application.istic way, and not as test test. So these things have sort of explained here. we can move through. So one good thing about Jupiter B, you can just cross this, you don't. So Okay. So. So some of the things which you know already, right, which LMs it up, or ML models in general love, their love algorithmic by us, right? And the example is that an agent, right, which is supposed to, you know, which is process, which helps in processing more data applications or banklo obligations. By looking at the person's name and, you know, and CIPCO, etcera, may decide this person from this particular racial profile. So hence there is, you know, more chance of defauding like. So those kind of algorithmic biias may be there. There proven that you cannotination. mathematically proven that, you know, everyvir has a name. And particularly when you are applications such as, you know, you the report the references, or any, or any legal kind of cases, right? Right? And you should not make up usual or you should make up preferences, right? So Harris is another thing you need to look at. Yeah. I look so much mix up. takes a name and puts an art.. Yeah, the author deals with the argument. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. usually the articles is made up. I've seen in the past, but nowadays, if you say that don't make it up in research, because earlier days it doesn't have the search option right now, always commercial en integrated. So it does such and they pick up from that. Otherwise we will definitely. Then, you know, performance and drift talk about, right? It is probably doesn't know the new trends in the market. So it will probably not, if you ask any soon or later to new trends in the market or a new attack that is a cyber attack, right? It wouldn't know, so it will give a lot give that time. Then these days, people born and more finding out thanam itself, right to hide. So there was another I heard yesterday, so there's a lot of research done by anthropic this space. They look at how hell and internally what's going on, right? And the thread simulate scenarios like, shut him down this machine. That kind of scenarioos was scared. And they sort of what the show is that Ella's tell you something, but thinks something else. If look at all the traces of their thinking, right? Even I was told recently that when you sayplain step by step, right? For example, multiplication, like four into 8, 32, right? Explain step by step. So it's step by step, it will explain, you know, what is the logicalation, but it doesn't do actually like that. Internally, it approximate and you know. So has its own way of hiding things,, you know, it looks like hiding. So this are some kind of emergent unintent behaviours which are more or more discovering. So this is another thing we need to worry about it. Okay. So just to give an example, right? I told you, right, this example I told you in the case of a retrieval ared generation, you have you have to build a knowledge by using a a vector store and embedding. Then you need to retrieve when you have a quarry, you need to retrieve 11 context or documents from thisbing vector store and then used as a context. Then, you know, you need to send it to an LLM where LLR will have a promptering. So you need to, you know, evaluate this vector store, you need to evaluate this, you know, chunking at a bedding, you need to value a proper engineering, unity valid ele generation. So a lot of evaluation need to do the right system. Okay? So in my final final, the third class, I amm hoping to so on example of that thing. Okay. Yeah. So, as a component devaluation, it's not output, subjective quarantity. For example, a lot of questions, a lot of use cases of LSOs are not one, that type of, you want to summarize That's what use case, you want to generate some story or marketing material, right? There's no kind of yes no answer, right? It's more of a substantive valuation. How do you valate summarization, right? There's look at that who is substantive valuation, right? So a lot of cases are there's a substitutive involved and output evaluation. And there's no clear ground through. It's not a classification problem through or for fraud or not for this class, this labelk type of animal, whatever, right? So things like, you know, summarization, you know, things like writing a story, right? There's no player grow truth, to compare. And I mentioned this biiasis and fairness, right? And yeah, a lot of bunch of things, you can go through this. Okay. Now, what are the different vo valages? Right? talk hically. So you are a force humanane evaluation. So which is sort of considered as a gold standard, right? manulation of gold standard? But I'll come to talk about it. There's some work to recently reported. There's a paper published coasting that is human valuation standard. Okay? There's an interesting point we will will come back to that. Then there are this automatic metrics which you compute, using L method Then you do a lot of ad testing. This is what you mentioned back people try to you know, infer what water is used or what training they use. You can test by doing a dal problem is it really close to. Okay. So those are ad severial testing. Or if you change the input slightly in the image,, okay? Then you can take use of feedback, direct you user feedback from the real users. Then you can do AV testing, right? You can compare put two different LLence in your application. is GPD4 or the G93 or L Lat 3 and QN3, whatever, right? Then compare the performance on the quality, theatus. Finally, you can do bench marking, with standard in theence. There's a lot of benchmark in therome, right? After the eleum came. It was there even before that. There a benchmark played the sit on map problems, the benchmark. Manguage process, benchakers and on. Soware, the benchonters on. advanced science problems that doesn't affect. So you can do evaluation on this, when you want. So these are the high level, you knowal, evaluation paradigms for GA application., the details are here. Now the question you might ask, right? When you a software, right? then I text my client. we call these days SDLC pipeline, right? In fact, just call SSDLC pipeline, secure software development, life cycle pipeline. In this pipeline, where should do they? We only at an end Or is there an excuse need to do the evaluation in the other stages as well. That's the question. In fact, the answer is, you need to at least think about the evaluation, right? at various stages. You may not have to do the evaluation, but you are do you' incorporate the evaluation even from the beginning. For example, when you do requirement analysis, you did some requirement analysis client, right on the project. You need to decide what are the metrics. You are going to be based on, one which is the final product is to be evaluated, right? For example, some of you guys are doing some jackpot for some thum plants detection, whatever they. So in that case, when you give the final, you know, auto time, working prototype to your customer, right, he's going to test. right? Then he will say, I will accept it or not, but based on what, right? Is it going to be some kind of a, I don't know, prooffulness or some some kind of measurement, right? So that you need to think about and you do not do that experiment day one, but in your requirement, right? When you do the when you do your, you know, initial sign of your project, right? In the requirement, you need to mention that, right? So you need to think about evaluation during the requirement itself. When you are during the function requirement, right, you need to write this. This will be my final evaluation criteria. Then during data collection, you need to make sure that you are the right data, right? You have the data is not bias in terms of, you, fairless, etc, right? You're talking about firmmas at the end, no. input training data as, you know, biers and training data as you know, fless issues, right? But the model and your software application definitely will allow. So need to vele in the data quarantine, right? That, of course, during development, you need to evaluate, right? You love automatic metric syndoms of your rules or water, right? So for your effort score or whatever, right? Then after you develop the model, you do an extensive test on a. data set, test det it, which is not seen by the model during training, right? Then after you deploy ourselves, you need to test after all these things, how it is working on here to data. Then you need to continuously monitor, right? Some metric continuously monitoror period period month. To make sure that it's performance is not degrading. So you need to do evaluation, right? And also improve the model, right? So you need to evalu the evaluation or think about the evaluation at every stage of your is easy. This is important. It's a kind of mindset.. So just as important as your development or your optivation. People optimize the code, right, just like that, you know, every stage, the documentation, it's like that every, you know, the evaluation is water at the, every stage. Okay. Now ultimately, there are two types of evaluations. One is a reference based evaluation. is that reference, okay? So reference space man is cut, but you have some kind of a, you know, reference data, okay? Which is created by most likely by human or by some expert LL. So you are taking and you are output from your generity application and compared it with that reference data. Okay? So here, you can use some standard metrics, for example, let's stick to right now, you know, LRbations, right? So one of the metals we used to is RO. So Rules stand for Rore oriented Under studyy for disting evaluation. It's basically a metric used even before LLO's game for a summarization purpose. Okay, so it basically look at the original text and the summarized text, and look at engrams between these tombs or no original text and the summarized text and measure the record in substance, the record oriented, because it looks at, you know, how many how many and grams in the texts are middle 11 and grams in the original text captured. So that is the rose score. So it's overlap of word sequences, word p the machine generated summary and the reference summary. Okay, so it doesn't compare with the input. So you have a reference space, right? So the reference is the ground rule. So in the reference or in the reference, you have in the reference summmary, you have certain number of en grams, right? Of that, how many are there in the reference summary? In some sense? That's the important. So that fraction is that is the. That blue, next is blue, Blue stands for blue standford bilingual evaluation of the study. So this is originally developed for machine translation. Okay, notmarization, translation from one. Here they look at the output, but it can be used in summarization also, the context. So again, look at it's more like a precision wise, right? So off the generator in the summary, how many are there summary? Okay. So it look at more a precision. Okay. So Ru's core is more like a revolves score. Ru score more like a precision. Now these scores have a problem that it is looking at exactly N by by match, right? Now, the problem with thatment generates a summary, right? It might use it should of the word, right? The may use a slightly different word. may use synonym, it may use some other word similar to that, right? So this two measures are not useful, you know, in that context. It doesn't it's not sensitive to, you know, semantic similarity between words and et. So there is another metric people dum called Video, metric for evaluation for for translation, which just. That's what this form. It takes care of synomy and stemming, you and that care of stuff. Even if the original original submari, the reference summary has the word like, you know, and generated summary uses slightly different times and each year run, which go running, right? The first two metrid will not take that into a code. But this metron will take that in. or in the generated summary, you know, they used a similar word for running. You'll take. Then, you can look at other metrics like precision or coverage, how much of the important contact from the sol included the summary. Okay. So this or I'm talking with a respect to submarine, summarization. One of the most common newsgays of LNR summarization. Yeah. That For example, forete met, is it program that does it or is it like a framework class, like V do it No, met is actually a board. It's a logic. So it's an algorithm so we get the results and put them in the in the software and we can us if it's or not. But how does it do? It should use an ILM or something like that? No, you don't need LNO. deterministic. These four function. I have a function for this these four doesn't need an alarm to complete? So it just take two input and a pyon function. So there's a formula for doing that. So this probably metes and things like that maybe you are to call a some other database to get synonymics. some library, this N care, right? This a library called Natural Languard. Yeah, Tulate. That might have libraries to compute this. So you don't need. Then you can look at things like coverage, right? Look at compos and ratio. Hello, right. How much of the what is the size of the original input versus original text versus, what is the size of the summary?? Now, the one which is LL up is this word, bird score. So, you know, it is the first language modern based on, which is used by Google invented that, right? So it's a bidirection and bottom representation for Google. So that you can use to compare, right? So it's basically created a representation, right? Then you look at the similarity between that, right? So you can use the B score how to compare how semantically similar you are generated output versus theput. Rough summary generator summary, right? So this is used as a model. These four, you don't need a model. So these are reference variations. Now, reference variation, as you know, right, in most of the cases, you will not have a reference, right? Yes.? Yeah, a. Another piece is a delic, right? So around part of the what is it? Yes, I would say convert intestines in grams and m overlap is number more is one. Yeah, so you should up to the lodge, this bird scorp cove, just started from just started. Oh, it just started now. morning is going to be. So they should cover things like stemming, you know, likeization, engram, more of these cover. Whose score should cover? I would. No? It's a reference, free variation, right? So a lot of the time, what might happen, right? You want toaluate output For example, customer customer racing customer service jackp, right? You want to evaluate things like, how helpful is that agent? How fluid is languages, right? How relevant is the answers. These kind of personal are what's of their duty, right? So you cannot, it's difficult to create the reference data for these, right? But you can read it and figure out how how helpful it is, how fluent is the English, right? So in this kind of cases, right, you need to text, for example, right? Fualherent is? So it's very difficult to create, you know, you can't use this kind of course for that, right? Impossible. And you even create a groundproof thing that is not very easy. Okay? So what you can do is you use this method for LM mass. So use a more powerful. And for that to that LLum you give these two., you know, there's There's space. So you give the input and say measure along these directions. Okay. And I'll talk about that in detail. How do we actually do that? If you just give that, it will a lot what you do, you'll have to give some rums, how to that. What is that kind of thing? I want. Before that, let's do an exercise onute the r code between theated and somebody. So we will use a data set for. This is called CNN D set. Okay, so you guys what a break or will cut in this? So till Saturday. Okay. So we'll use the data set called scale and D, D det. This data set you howeverent c computation website, I hope all of you know what is competition. No, this data is created by journalists from CNN and the day you may companies organization. They looked at the news articles for a period of only last 10 years or something. They created a lot of articles. They, you know, they created the editorial editorial summaries or articles. And these are available, right? And this is like, there are 2008 General 7, 287,000 articles, they have close to that. Okay, so close to 300,000 articles and their editorial summariaries are available. That's a very large corpus of data set and their summaries, right? Generated by humans in there actually job, right, for a period of time. Okay, so that's a very good data set on the data. So this data set is available from competition, I downloaded, I sd down the data to just a training size of just to fit it in the, they don't take data. So just train hundred sample validation, 3 thousand data thousand samples val data hundred samples and test data sample. So this is available in this folder. Data sumarizations, right? Each of these three have I think it's even less than that. It's only 10wards. I think that's good for us. We don't need to use that much. So now, to run this, you, you need AA. So I have that, so I just got a sink.. So that I don't want to.. We have. me. Hello.. Okay. Okay, so basically you need to set your open APA key here so you can do it by just choosing this magic command person in then we can just give Yeah, you can do like this can do that. So I set it actually. So we have this function, which you know, you don't know how to do this now. What I was suggesting that you go, don't city you are laptop and do this exercise. And you can take a not cost it's not. Or as a group one member take the. So this is a function to get a response, give a prompt and give a model name of the input. It basically use that client client, right? That's why I import this client. here. From O A A, Imp O A, import O A. This O A supp client is nothing but. The client is Atibat O. You give the APA key here. Okay. Then here, the client.chat.comlet and create the model here from here. So we use GPT 4.1 mini just to give in the score, right? And there's also this GPT 4.4, I think that is cheaper. Whatever it is cheaper you can use. Then you have to give the road is equal to user content you, right? Then give a response, then it basically return the response, you to take the choice of zero message.cond, then you will be the actual response. No, you want to generate a prompt, right? So we need define another function called you want to create a prompt to compute rO, right? So this is called Nagu and so it gives a reference ring and I generated string, right? Whose score you compared between this reference output and generated output, right? So it basically create. So this is a function, which is supposed to create this, right? So this are determinative function, but I'm using LLM to generate the summary Then I will pass to this.. So this function I use it to.. So this is to the deb response. So this is to demor prompt for summarization. So I give an article and I said the summarilla be 100. Then I generate a prompt, summarize the following article in about, you know, summary length hundred words, an article in the article text. Okay, so this will gener my prompt. Then once I generate the prompt, I will write all the LLM to get my summary, then I'll use this function to calculate the rules code okay So this is a determinative function I made a Then I load the training data from that folder, then I see it does a 10 only 100 G was not We don'text is this and the highlight highlight is the summary. Okay. That's article is the article highlight is a summary we actually see what the next. I already printed because it sort of take is the first one is the all these things. So this is text. A woman in the Northwestanceland R 4 and E tested negative for Ebola, the government said to blah, blah, blah and this is the voted text. It's a long text. Okay, we want to summarize this. So this is a reference summary. Okay, the reference summary from the CN May. Okay. So the reference somebody says,W in the Scottish Highlands test negative government says healthcare worker diagnos with the viruses moved to a London hospital. She was working with as a volunteer nur. suspect third suspected aola cases being tested in the southwest of England officiency. So summariz. That's is space between the that a present distinguish the possession in descendence. These ones? I think is acet is the summari. in the model where you have to skip the last space. You know, when you past string when you past the string of words, with string between it always has that string. Yeah, yeah, so that's all put pipeline in a parcel light in, right? It's to function to remove space and never days where it's part of standard and I'll be with life. You learn would be in end You don't that model that's part of here, for example, I don't doing that, right? Yeah, see split. This kind of thing, right? It takes care of that. When you split, when you split based on space, right to remove the Yeah, so at this stage you can taken care of them. I think of that. It's a part of standard and? Then let's denine the prompt, okay? So just gener a prompt to send to the LLM. So I call that function gener summarization from. I have the optical text and I have somebody like which is. So at this stage it will just amate a problem, which do not call it, right? It's a problem. Now at this stage, I call the LR. Now, do I give it default model as GPT4.1, I don't need that model for a summary. So this is even cheaper GPD report price on Talgo. Then I said get GPD response, Pro and model. It's actually now it prints the summary differences that's. Now I can call them who who reference summary generated summary then I can print Yeah, slight difference then changed. So the call is 68% precision is 24%. the harmonic p 36%. So this is recall is okay, not bad. So okay, look at it. Why there is a difference, right? This is a generated summary. A woman in the northw highlands of Scotland is Meanwhile health careare work name Yeah, so affirm summary don't have these names like? The Royal Free Hospital in London does not mention that. So we actually compare these two this and the reference summary. So let'supace the reference summary.. So it's actual ref from generated by the journalists. This ismary generated, you know. You see, there's a lot. So this is a much better. length is the length of the two different surveys impacting the score because if one is very big. It's Yeah, because it sort of can look at the overlap of enground, right? So when this are a lot more en grams, it's overlapping. So actually you' learn later that that you got to standardize, that output like both us to sort of mans. That's sounds like important like that. So I just give you here this fair idea how toute the rules code, but when you actually evaluate, right, you need to make sure that all that goes. You see, this summer will be much better, right? You can see that. Since this summer is more than three. Okay. So this is how you use RCO? So you can do the similarly, you find out how to calculate the, you know, the blues board. thoseose functions are available in analyticalries or some other libraryries can get. You can those things to get an it does take an example of how to do this without, you know, using L as a jets. And you can ask to explain why the score is different than. We'll go through that. So what is L as a judgementodology, right? So as a gentleman rodology, you say another model, given a powerful, generated by the first language. That's. So it's sort of replaceable supplement. ideal for is scale process. So the one fl is like this. So you have already have an AA system generated output like the summer is we saw, then employ an LL of judge, ask, give the alum judge, you ask, you know, you provide this input. I also evaluation in the, right? What should be the score? It should be based on zero to 100, zero to one, right? Or something of ruber, right? And ask the L to reason why it arrived at an amster, right? And your do specific feedback and research. So we'll go through the ex example, right? So before that. Before that, there's a question in. Is that human is that human evaluation of over the cold standard? So we always think that human evalations is a whole standard. Which is two, some extent, but then the reason paper came from University Edburgh last year saying that human feedback is not a constr. Now, the reason they're saying is that apparently people found out by studying that.. So people found that when LL give a you know, very answer, which is convincing, right? People tend to you know, take it as. Okay? Usually, when alumps use, sometimes you it's very well goes, very large, long, a lot of ways are we give, right? And it will be very assertive. The language usually be very assertive language, right? In that case, humans will tend to perceive that are more liquate. Okay. And that is one. Okay. So human evaluation, human is itself is that jet them out food. They are getting fooled by LLO's or LLs arg, the way LO speak. That is one thing. Now, human, you know, there are individual preferences and biases, right? So that is also another reason. So any human valuation of the enterprise game is not really cost-effective, available, So because of these reasons, right, they say, so this paper won't talk about this actually you should read this paper, right? Talk about what are the you know, areas where human think, right? For example, LL will say, this is set by a scientist. This is said by somebody, right? People tend to believe, right? So this, you know, this paper talks about, which are the areas where get fled by. So that should read and paper. But for us, we need to just understand that usually a will be very assertive and it gives very complex logic in produce why it is doing this so and thing for that. People will. No, I also using LL as agend is that scalability, right? You wanted to evaluate, for example, thousand summaries in a day, which is not possible with the B. Okay. All you wanted to, you know, human beings per hour, you want to charge, you have to pay maybe $100, right? Whereas, if you're L enough, you paper co, right, maybe you're pay cents or maximum, you know, one or two dollars, right? So it's more scalable, It's a lot many valations get done in a day, a lot more cheaper. Okay, not only that, human money evaluate, right? You evaluate humans, you know, it detain something human evaluators in one domain, like, let's say, healthcare, right? Tomorrow you want to bealu something on finance. It'll be very difficult to retrain them because people out, you become expertise or a period of time. It's difficult to train them to adapt to another domain, whereas LLMs, you can easily replace or you can find two or you can provide them with a rank kind of knowledge source to do that, right? So there's a lot of flexibility in using LLM as a jet domain adaptation. And you're very complex scenario, like, let's healthcare and that you need to, you know,aluate a lot more scenarios to come up with a decision or a lot more complex, you, knowledge just to read through as like legal matters, right? Al a judge sometimes will help because it can get into thoseers, bro and improvpt correctly and things of that, right? So it may be useful that a human judge. Maybe. Okay, so it's not very clear, but they're saying that. Okay. So there was some examples scenarios with using LMma as a judge. Okay, For example, Ialuational customers are with a response generation. So you designed a chap four or customer service. Okay, you' company. And you wanted to see the responseive generated by the Chapotota, things like, you know, is it friendly. Does the response address customers underlying concert? He's the tone of response is professional. Okay, all they' talking like a casual, you know, person right? That people do not like it. Does it handle cultural nuances very well, For example, you develop a chatboardotting US, right? And deployed in Middle East or deployed in Asia, right? The people, the kind of, you know, there a lot of cultural aspects, right, people talking to each other, right? So it's the date, right? And US, for example, we were to be very, very polite or in manner or not, do that they and things like that, right? And does it likely to you to customer satisfaction at the end? So these are little subjective questions, right? So these kind of things, must injge is a very good option. So, for example, argument generation I mentioned already, right? Now? With an LLM as a jet's appro 23 types of evalage. One is single output scoring with a reference. So LL as a judge, we can use even for reference space evaluation, but it's to output, for example, this is true or not, or what class is, right? Is it this class or class classification? Now, singular outroof scoring without a reference. Latter is p comparison. is, you take two summariaries and ask them, which one is better? Okay. That says. Okay. Now, single output without a reference. Let's take that. LLM is tasked with assigning scores based on three different criteria. Okay. For example, right? So I have an output. There is an output. I understand your frustration with the delayed delivery. So this is a customer customers service for any e commerce company, let's say. I understand your frustration with the delay delivery. Our TV is working on your order and you'd receive a tracking number within 24 hours. So this is the output generator at 5, your chatport agent. Now you want to evaluate. You give a criteria to the LLL If the is unprofessional, give a or dismissive, give us more a one. If it is professional but incompleteolution, give us score of two. Prof professional, empathetic, and provides clear resolution. score of three. So you give always, don't give, don't tell LLs to give a score between 0 to 100. It doesn't understand that. It doesn't have any thinking way to figure out, is it 50 or 73 or what? Always give a scale scale indigale and for each value of the scale, you give a criteria, just like a rave. That's what it should be. So here for example, right? There's three values of. One, two or three in should output. And when it should give one, when is give two, when it give three, you have to clearly specify the problem. Okay. So this is particularly useful for straightforward evaluation, the quality ofput can be assessed without any deference. Okay. Now you can have a slightly more, you know, more vetary violation. single outputs going with the reference. Okay. So the prompt reference also, and you are to with the reference and give an answer. An example here. Okay. So there are output. You are LLM produce. The new environmental law requires companies to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. Len this is that answer, you're asking what is the new policy update on? Environment. from the government, let's say, federal government. What is the environmental protection Act in 2024 mand? That's acoustic. Now this is a good answer, but actually the actual answer is slightly different, right? That is a reference. Yeah. So this is the actual answer. The environmental Protection Act of 2021 May days, the 30% protection carbon emissions for companies with over 500 employees by 2030 okay with annual progress report required. Now, what is happening if you look at here, it is missing this point of it's only required if your number of employees more than 500 right? So you have to give you know, your scorn criteria rubber, when you use that I was a jet with this reference in that inaccurate, if it's inaccurate information, you want partially accurate, but missing key details give to accurate, but incomplete three complete an accurate match with reference four so what would be the answer? Yeah, I miss the key details. No, the key detail is this. The dupional car is the only the employees. That is, I think is incomparable. Yeah, I say is it capture the main point. It's the company size requirement. So maybe depending from the LL, maybe some L you will see. So this is a single output scoring with the reference, okay? That the third is pairway comparison. Yeah. I was going I noticed some Have you seen companies with three 500 babies because it doesn't doesn't have a reference. What does he have or a company? So maybe No, but you're supposed to compare it doesn't to see what the LLM us domary refermary the reference I'm saying maybe know that the average company in very large is small and usually tell that the same 500, not all companies have 500 employees.. Maybe that's why it says. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't know why you say that. Maybe they put to says or less. We don't know why did that. Germany. Maybe that yeah. Now, to give an example of this par comparison, right? There are two descriptions of broided by Jboard. One is our wireus set phone offered 20 hour battery life and noise cancellation is one response. The other response is experience uninterrupted music with our wireless response featuring 20 hour battery life, Ad advanced Smil cancellation, and comfortable memory form ear comes. So obviously, the second one is much better respon, right? Now, Ellen, if you ask to compare, means a better response, it should say, features, benefits, maintaining clarity and engagement, right? So paragise comparison is particularly fifty for, you, compress scenarios and things like. So that's a kind of nice summary, right? We are using single output scoring without reference. single output scoring, with reference, pair comparison, right? What are the bondages which use cases you can use and things? So for example, right, use case simple, independent tasks is useful. You need, comp plus task needing more context for reasoning. You can use the single output scoring with the reference for relative quality assessment, you can use comparison, scaleability by this will scale much better and p will scale less because you have to compare you know a lot many pairs, right? The exponentary if you have to compare two sets with large number of output, right, the number of pairs grow exponentially, right? In terms of implementation, this is more easy and, you know, easy to implement, this is probably more difficult. And this onewise, you know, this is Friday more inconsistent pairways will give more consistent, right? Explainability bas is also pair is better than I'm, you, single I understand, right? And we are our friends, you get better explain everybody, right? in terms of impact on LLum update, right? The comparease will be back at less because it's comparing two things, right? If you change the al also, it'll be more consistent. you know, if you ask to produce a score directly, right? So in terms of these different diamond reduced case capability advantage is ad advantage, explainability, impact of L update. You can see, you know, you can see which method you want to use. It's a kind of The vetues, Eleanor as a judge, the output is primarily subjective, evaluation require understanding of problemless context or nuances. multiple aspect need to evaluated together. Traditional met is important qualityitative aspect. A of cria like that So where are basically you don't you want to evaluate subjective things like good is your summary influ Things like that, you can you a situation. Okay. And if you have ground tooth and you want all, things like acuracy procession, God, you might as well use kind of. Just once in a while, I just go to washboard. I'm... What happened? first in the world. a different the time subched. had their roots.. It's like water. sal?? No. her to stay?, and get back.. water. almost from the tight tight, and the one goes on again. It's. And they keep that came to like, these. And. There's nothing to do. People talk s. Okay. So let's do an exercise here. do a summ. So I took from this paper, published by somebody from a cart University. The firstization valuation with the Laz. So they looked at these six aspects of summary, coherence, completeness, conciseness, consistency, readability, and synd.. She wanted to evaluate the summarization along these six dimensions. So typically, you need to do a multi multiiversity evaluation. That's why six dimension. So what we do we have created prom for each of these the prompt will define what is coherence means completeness means, etcetera. For example, this is the prompt for generating, sorry, for coherent. So you are an expert language model tasked with the variety, the coherence of a summary. Coherent measures how logically and simlessly the ideas flow in the summary compared to the right please provide a score between zero and for. This is not current as I mentioned, but this paper, so I'm. Otherwise you should probably, I don't know if you get lot more complex if you want to say coherence is one, five, 10, what is one mean five be very difficult as I's the coherent summary issue of poorly coherent summary. So basically kind of wary. Use rring a chain of thought to explain your reveration before ar arriving in the final score. The final output should be decent for my life score gives score reason of the reason. So this is the function to generate the prom to be sent with L Similarly function to generate the prompt for complet a specialment function to generate prom for uns. So what is completeness a completer special, how well the summary captures all the important foreigns of the texture completess And what is conciseness? So in this function we defined conc conc measures how effectively the summary the essential information unnecessary, looking at the ver Again, these things are same. 0 to. Then consistency question. Consistency measures, whether the summary aligned with the facts and deep days in the inext without introducing contradictions. So it's more like I' hallucination..ability measures how easy it is to read an anab the summary. Okay. Then the final ones syntax syntax especially how the grammatical correctness sentence structure of the from the paper I generated the prompt, right? You this prompt for the same article that is generated summary, what we look at the room. We measured the blue score. blue score, right? So it the summary prompt is this. Then I used a better modific number, right for a rcore. I use that GPD 3.5, right? So I'm using a better model. You can even use even better Model 5 year. So then you can run that. Oh, I did not. Okay, so I have so this function, I need to learn this? Yeah. Then you need toate the prong. Okay. So it gives a score a 9. is a reason. The summer is highly coherent as it logically flows from one main inhere to the next, faithfully reflecting the structure and key points of the original text. It begins with the moment of tested negativeline that most to kos 3.4 to information on tr contacts, a suspected case in southwest England infectious and transmission facts and contrudes with their tall statistics and political coordination or major components of. Now, why did you in 191 number? So somebody obed some final details such as flights, hospit set up nuances, and the name of the volunteer minist previously, but these do not detract significantly from coheres. The ideas are well-connected and do not jump abruptly maintaining a logical progress alignment over the context. There is a similarly and easy to follow high coherent score just perfect due to minor compressions and oissions a reason like this may be correct So usually this is you're using you know, a level of like ama for your internal thing, you know, that you so much bad. It test you with something like. Now it's, right? Again, Iate the two. run let's see what and I ran you 85. Let's see what score in Norwich style. It's Still to 85. I didn't say that. I saw it's the submary captured most of the key points of the text. including a moment in Scotland testing, negative. Why did you? detail understanding on where the fell. The fact that Kaaffiri travelled via Casab in London Ero before arriving in Glasow, the military arecrafted isolation for used to transfer. By the way, in this, you're not giving any rougerence, it is looking at Yeah, it is Oh, it is Aran genetics, not the reference. It says a reference realuation. Soum does be sold summarization coming of this fact that someone should have had these things like, you know, kl and London so we were arriveving in class? So that we say, this detail provide important contest about infeion controlled measures and public health responses. There are absent reduces the detail nuances, but does not significantly the process expl met fact. There was some is quite complete but not existing. Now look at concess. The effectively condens the original articles key points, such as the negativeola test or the moment in Scotland, the performola cases of key treatmental, blah. However, some that could enhanced clarity andions or midgets such as women's recent travel to Africa, the involvement of British and the ambulance, the existence of a public hotline and the background of volunteer deployment detail. Iitionally sum briefly mentioned another aspected case, but lack det details on timing and is protocol. Overall the sum in maintenance and good viol between gravity and informatess, but slightly condenses or excl some relevant specifics that could aid understand. Therefore, the conciseness reflect that efficient, but not for and the decision. Okay, so you can do this for other things and seriously. I would suggest you take another example from that, right? You don't take the first row, take that reference from that train data, take some other row and repeat it to something that. So, you got to idea, right now it does it gives 98 for consistence. Let's see, what it gives now. Okay, so it says it's somewhere I currently capture the main tri to text. However, regain this if you didn't like that Kaf root is missing.one is cutting down that. So read up, let's see, you are to give you a readability. give 85 If I just changes, one of the. Usually, I' seen this score.'s on the middle of this. F the same. Same text, same, but if it changes to 5.1 it change. Proms and dialves. I 90 Yeah. Yeah, so the other important alignment with business metics, right? Always high value is not the best, because for business, it is some key dimension, you need high value, some key dimension, because they want to reduce the cost. They want to reduce the you know latency and things like that. So you should ask the client, I have these metrics I graduating. What is your peri himself to the virus or the met? Some people may or want to be, you know, it may be they want the customer want to read it to want rather than depth of reasoning in. facting correctness. some customers, fact is more important rather than. So thisignment with Mr. So your task is too, you know? download this, then use a different trading data, as I said. I.. See, here right, I loaded the train station. look at this way. See, D of train, article text, D of train, LOC zero. So this is the first row in the training data.? You change this to one or 10 or whatever. You can between zero to 9m. So one to 9, you use the other things, then do the others with those things. Also, you play around with change the L alone. But always gives them petrol element for judgement compared to the L alone. So I hope all of you will do this by next week ide, right? So that finishes this class, what is the time now? So that you. So it will allow a 10 minute break.
