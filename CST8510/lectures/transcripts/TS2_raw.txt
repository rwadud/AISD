World score. I also mentioned that when you evaluated an element application, you evaluate every component of that because each component and degration can cause the end result. Also different. Then it mention it in our front data, A lot of cases of a lot of cases of element use cases are very subjective marriage, right? beauty valate something like a chapport generated response for customer. You want to evaluate at least the response and how informative it is, what is the tone of the response? It is a very subjective. So you cannot not to create a standard digestive and pressure of those things. So what is typically done is using a more powerful anllum and using LLM as a approach. And So LO has a g for itself in three different ways of create. One is met without all of friends, and another is with a friends, and third, is a comparison. And this method is not free of any issues, because there are a lot of issues a jets, so what has to provide the template with the proper rubbeates and proper instructions, and always better to give a ask and score of on individual scale and provide for each individent value what should be the criteria explicitly, right? So that's a difference. Then what are the biases in LLM? Typically Lylums, it is known that al alum like tooth you know, use text which are generated by similar class of L. For example, if you're using a GPT as a GPD file, as a jet, right? It mayer the texture that by GPD4 compared to Gini, because the kind of language words and everything, right, it's in depends upon about trading data use hot parameters, what type of alumment is. Also, it is known that if you put a references of great people inside your your text, there's say some scientist and just from the students at this. Then will give us preference, just like us, it has a bias towards authorities. So you need to remove all that. So there are some cgeria to avoid these telephone v. So if you do all that, take care of all that is a good method. Very good mother. And if you repeat it, and if you do it with you know, for different gangers, it's a very good mother evaluating, the output of. recursion with himself. Like, you Yeah, that is that, so that is self re evolution, right? So I could begin. Yeah, that you you get some answers. Yeah, so that is there. There's a part of property starting you, right? Theursing property. Yeah. So that is differently there. But we are talking about not that. We are talking about evaluating a application right? So then we need to, you know, evaluating each component what are the metric. slightly different. But yes, sly you can ask the L to do self-reflection and improve the results. Yes, yes very much. So that's ofting strategy is more a. Okay, so this is the kind of backgroundhouse of real work we did last last week. So today we will talk about slightly different aspect a little bit more deeper into this whole evaluation. So we'll talk about some of the evaluation frameworks, right? So what I mean by framework is that you know, some of these there are two aspectories. One is that you need to collect data, right? What hell is doing. So when you build that LLM application, like a r reg generation? So you need to know what was the of course, you know the problem, and you know the final answer, maybe, but in between what happened, right? For example, you might have put like what you said, right? Self reflect, and give an answer. So what it is doing self- reflecting wasn't during that step, what it was thinking, right? Or during so. So in the case of a rag, right, it first take your quoery, converted into an amading, and quarery against the better database to get the context, right? So what are the context to, right? So how do we see that? If you want to evaluate each component, right? We need to see what was those values if you or what was the LL of thinking if it was doing self-relection, right? So we need to log these things somewhere, right? If you want to do an offline evaluation, right? So how do you log these things? How do you capture these? So this whole thing is called observ mobility. So if you look at today in cloud or even in in LLums, right? Oarality is a big thing. It's an area now. It's a big area in MLOs, right? This is the whole thing more observability. So today I'll talk about, you know, what is observability and how to instrument observability in your LLM application. Okay. Then I'll talk about a couple of frames like G, Zas, So these or D. So these are frameworks open source framework which is developed where it comes with some of the pivus metals, like the, you, how to give rum, right, or that other pric I mentioned about the true score, meteor, all that, right? And so it does a lot of these met of many what I call pre-built metrics. You just want to call those libraries. So you don't have to create or write your romeric. You just off write the condition input output. So these frameers are useful in that sense. Okay So I'll talk about these frameworks and I'll go you some of the other examples. Okay. So what is observability? observability means trying to understand or ask you know, try to understand a software system by kind of not going into into the code and going through what logic is implemented, rather, looking at the input and output, okay? And some of the intermediate components. Okay? So looking at basically by looking at some kind of logs, trying to understand the behaviour of the system. If observing, it's input account. That is basically observability, right? Ask the boat system behaviour without needing wrong all implemented. So this is a useful diagnose and resolve. The So to deeper at the software system to understand its how he's behaving as the world att even know have no idea behaved the system is working properly. You need to know probably higher architecture, but I don't know. If it's referring something but you don't know if this answer is enough, correct. moment in software. Yeah, so you so what you do is that you implement observability at every every level, right? You implement of servability at, you know, at each formal level insect. Okay, and you can do that, and each functional level inside, you can blow. And you can actually, you know, provideput output. So celebrity will help in some sense to figure out where is the problem, okay? But you might have to do further logging to figure out what's the r. Okay. So it's particularly useful in. You see, today, it's softer architects today, a few of this microsoftaces. So when you send the course for the application for something, right, it goes to a path. So it probably called one service.ase, get something, Then it go call an APA, get something else. Then take this toput and for L11 and get something else. goes where distributed system of, you know, microsocaces.? So this observability actually trains the entire root of the unquest and collect data from each point, better data. It's really colour metadata. Okay, then give you that padata. So I'll show you some of the logs and then you can understand what it means. Okay. No. So, obs is a kind of, you know, process, right? Oervurity is I have is a kind of a a method of, you know, understandingness of phys system. Tory, he's way of, you know, teleary is a type of data, right? Telementary data, just like image, just like text. Tele is a data kind of data, emitted, you know, for oxility. When you instrument of. So tell me the data typically so you guys are not familiar with logs, right? Everybody familiar with laws, some kind of dog or not. It sort of extend that concert of laws into fans, races, metrics, laws,. So in this particular thing the most modern thing is what is for a place. Partularly generative application. Trace is what I said that it is the path of the request. that Tracing some. a path of the reverse where you know, software applications, a reverse will go through the software application, you're a distributed application, and each component in that, right? So again, if you take an example of a rA application, use a send a request, right? Tell me about, you know, this particular, you know. Let's say, take cybersecurity. Okay. So what do you know about this type of attack? What is a mitre, you know, technique corresponding to this type of attack? It's a sequel injection. I wanted to understand more about sequel injection. I build a r database where, you know, there is something about biter framework, which is a kind of a universal kind of knowledge base about all the attached techniques. How do you that? How do you spell that? MITI Mitre attack. Okay. So I ask a question. So I'm thinking because I work in the domain, so easy for me to construct an example. So I ask a question, I am cyber security administator, I ask a question, what do we know about my sequel injection, sequel injection is an attack technique? What do we know about, you know, what does mititer say about sequel injection? frame about sequal injection. So that query first goes to a veteran database where the mitre technics are stored, right? So that's one, right? I have this question, the question then converted in a wedding. That's a second step. So third step. So, Okay, so let me explain the.s required from He can join when you are sitting here. That's what you think.. Take one of the one's Toronto, No, even these like, yeah, each because you can think about. So let me explain this to the board. Like a weather event. Yeah, so I have it I have. It's too much. So you have a vector store. to the eventually, it will be passed out. So I Did you have a LR, right? Did you have I'm pretty sure to teach only one particular system. So you have a query? It's gonna be only one. So the first? Learning one particle system is easy. I know, I know to do. Then this empty will program out. get context Food programming, right? Then this query along with the portex, right? So this query. along with the context, will be sent to Aram. Then will response.. So this is a typical, man, or rag flow, right? So this is where I have told about, let's say, my red techniques.. It's just to be an example, or it could be right, travel, some related to travel. Yeah. So those techniques you're talking about mat techniques is stol in database, are they in the vector database? Yeah, they are they are already veerized? They're allized, right? So that's your knowledge base.ledge. So let's take even a simple example, right? SX and travel. So I have some travel information store here. So this is my So let's take a travel, maybe, but travel, right? All I St. So this is a pricker sir, right? You are to build the life. So right for everybody, I assume, right? Everybody knows what is the life. name again..onym? Yeah.. generator.. Anyway, so, I just want to explain the officer of Liberty. That's why I go on these things. Right? Now, when you ask a query, right? So query first convert into inbody. So this is the first step and then comes here, second step, ask her DV. Then there's an output, right? There's a third excuse. Then it goes to L level. This is four, LL 5. right? there's astep here, maybe this is four, combining these two. And this is five and clear. Right? So it pra means when I send it one request, right? So there's its. So there will be a trays created. When I send a particular quory, right? There's a particular query, let's say how is the of the the best places to visit. Places to visit in Paris, let's say. Of course, you know that you don't need a knowledge way just because, right? So this is my query. When I generate this query, send it to LLM, right? There's a trace generator. So there will be trace with trace ID. So that trace ID capture the entire path of this, what happens during the entire path of this. Okay, and it consists of sps. So consists of sps. So what are sp spans are what happened during each of these tal? What happened duringmers to everything? What happened during many query the You know, when you query this p, what happened then did you combine the context with the wedding, then what happened during LLM call, etcetera, et cetera? So this trace will consist of several packs, burn. fan blue, later. Maybe at least six. Okay. So, the t consist of sps and the span allowed the detail of, you know, what happened here. So I can show you an example. Now, you may have multiple records rights your one day. You know, they're saying, who asked 10 different post days. So what these traces you can come and something about a session. So the session comes aola, so I didn't mention that. So typically there's something for a session, session I. So the hierarchy is something like session plays back, something like this. Session. Session. I can weer levelity session. whether a different cloud, they might say different things are. Trace them very common. And session will love multiple trers. And each trer will have multiple spans. And each place corresponding to one coast. Okay. And each span corresponding to what happened. during one operation, within these, for example, wearing a particular operation during a r, right? So one span will contain detail about one author operation. The clear? So this is a kind of high level answer. It's. Now, so I'll show you some examples from this. Now. So there are different standards of implementing this clority and the most common standard, which is for open terri is an oper source industry standard for instrument name of celebrity. Okay. And. So now the Bus is how you is theendous, right? Are you working? Put all this into a c? No. Each function by function are you going to, you know, instrumentsing that, you know, just like you do logging, right? So there are different wayses of instrumentation. One is called a SDK based. So here what you do is that. Yeah, if you want to believe it really granulty, but similar grularity if you want to do get obserty, you to do you know, manually go to each function and do that, right? That will give you maximum control, but that's very laborious, right? And it's sort of create problem in terms of plocking. It's worrying on to change from opera elementary to something. It change out the sport, right? So instead of what is done, is what an autoization. To get use of autoimization using operative standard itself. So what it does is that it does something about a monkey patching. So dynamically, it will at the time of executing the function, right? It create a rapper So you call the original logic plus it will emit the bas let's say an example say you are using a operate chat completional library for creating the cost from LL. Okay. So you wanted to create prices from it. So if you instrument in using auto tracing in oper elementary, what it does is that it takes original O AI API, that function and create a wrapper, right? A dynamically to create a wrapper. So the wrapper inside the rapper, it will still call the original A ABA, plus it emits the r. So this way you don't need a minimal phone changes. You don't need So all the thing is that at the top of the function. You just have to buy recorator. Just want to call one line saying that what race. You can I' show you some code. I' do it. And so we don't need more, you know, inside the function of run of the blade, right? And you can change the more of one to change the change, and but it hasn some das in the sense that sometimes those auto racing can create conflict with other logging libraries, you logging or whatever. But typically that is what you use. This is the mostly tomination using auto instrumentation. Then the dirt approach is called a proxy base. So here what is done is that the the typical is the application Led through a third body server. as a server and that server sort of, you know, extract things from theputed ofputal log. So that is that is a third. Okay. So three ways using SDK, actually create, you know, that some. So all of instrumentation or proxies. as said, what does observability data contains? It contains variaces which record therete int of the obligation. And each place cons of, which is the what happened what happened inside that specific operation that that. So this is for example open elementary trades. There's a place ID, and just for the cross span, as a span ID and there's the par ID's got this place is a first place. It's a susp. When you take the first p in, for example, right, creating embody, right? So you run quant embodying model and create an embody. So that is the first span. Therefore, there's no parall, right? Or if you to see subsequent spans, because you want to connect in a trace, right, the spans. So this span will not have parent already, but then the next span, right, the span corresponding to retrieving the context from a vector DB, that we will a work spaniel, its own span ID, then there will be a span sp span ID, which is span ID of this operation. That's how it will be changed. Okay, so every operation will allow its own pan ID, and then the p pan, which is the span idea of the previous operation. Okay. So that's a parad ID, then what the start find ent means Which means that the facing was successful. Then there's a lot of attribute. For example, here is where you can, you know, include whatever you want to draw, right? For example, this is is not anagram called that corponding to some network. So you can include, for example, you know, attribudes like your IP, IP address sport number, most I, achieer, right? So I'm rain for that you can with the law. And some events, also you can capture it. So this is an example of ale and this something like this in general. So I'll show you more example later. Yeah, so the, you know, you. Yeah, so then actually are from because I installed, you know, Asian can actually know if you instrument agent in Air right, you can see. So there's the dash in the dash is like this. You have this place and you different spans. You fall at theation, execute. So this is an example, so there is created for computing fubat number. Okay? So you're supposed to so the agent is supposed to write a python function. to calculate the figonology sequence and when you ask this question, calculate 50 fibon number or whatever, it will just execute that function, then let a tool, like agent calling a tool, okay and then calculate that number and give you. So that's agent created. Now, in this ages, you see, it's actually there's a step by, I bought a p further, and that p further bought a predict stream, I think that p stream, you got an N that Lide, understand was that what is this? I don't what is this? That understand that I want to graduate number. So this in the first query and a I do that two is a function. So that function qu is here. So here, the vital c for for number, define tribonizing and they say in the. Now, it will all this function, ex, and then it will c out all theated to complete my answer. So this is a sequence that happened, just like the rack application, right? So this is a sequence of operation happened in. And it's actually given the trace, with the trace, each of the susp, any post? Okay. As far as. Yeah, any oppression that they not in that operation detail. So let's give some exercise, right? How about example for places of television. So I don't. He wants. Okay, I' trying to run this now. Hello. W This is Y. All right.. Yeah. I just started to set the old man. So let's try to run at four. Okay. So you need to install this store. Okay, so you're to import this function for. So there's aary report of elementary. So to install point racing, open elementBK, and I decided to in. So I already installed. Then you need to import this place, then a place provider simple span for span Ex export. Then you initiate these things. and you said,Ter, place, good placer. Some new name. Then you import some standard. Where do you? I don't... Spacing is yours. It's like ching this day... You should have stopped stoping that. them? Oh, tkey.. Our projects. We should start developing in work. You know, we're paying a flaw. It's not AA included. How much is aA? Theest ones. In is huge. Ces. can I use month for now? Oama? Yeah. Because we have the installed, like 10 GB fire. We can, but it's slow. We're waste too much time. We're trying to deal up. It's too slow. I's see how you have MacBook is fast. I, Okay, so I did this now. So I have this three functions, okay. So this is what I wanted to place. So it's a print, it's a print, hello, say hello function. So this function has what it has basically takenring Say hello, let's form my apple string. So there is a function for format string, thisys function format string. So that function, define here. Define format string, right? inside this function, it does forming the streng. Then there's another function. It takes the formatated strings, which is for a hring, and the print. So there's a method called print h. So this function, basically called these two functions. So I wanted to, you know, man of instrument.. Displacing in this and I call this function. So how do we do that? So I initiate the tracer, my tracer is, you know, hopper tracing dot tracer. Then in this function, so I have to start with saying withaser. start as current span, Give the span name, say hello. The inside the span, Iide what I wanted to go under the span, what I wanted to capture inside the span. Okay, so that says span said attributes. Okay, so you basically dog might capture my inside this plant. Okay, that's what this plan doing. Similarly, these two function also, I can implement phasing with this command. I can add even sp format. So string format even happen. What do the value for my string? So I captured the ordinental string here and the formatical string here. Then why did it print, right? I by. So if you had an email, you' saying that print and then, even was called. That is captured in the sea. So this is a very basic example of how to do the how to do the tracing, right? Now if I run this, I ran this here. So I, then I actually pause this function, say, word. If I do that, so just say hello, we place right, that place you. statement, you have a two piece there. Yeah. You just sounded, yeah, the red on the line. Down there, down there. Yeah. We got the field statement. F Salo up there little bit up. Up on the code. Yeah, here. here. Oh, I cannot. command, it should be one., huh. Oh, yeah, you are calling the function, right?. Indentation problem?ribute. No, it's complaining that ner. So where is a place? What is tracer? Tracer, a new tracer? Tr tracer? That's. Tr of experience... me.. The thing is tell that the mission be shown that? I one and two. I one for two. True.. place for these. Yeah, of course. is tomorrow morning. We have an at the tour, right? 22, four, and then 5 to 7. Yeah, maybe this is. Yeah, so maybe I would feel that the bush is. Yeah, so that's something we shoot with this in the safe. But it's not working before, so. Yeah, so I did what happened is that this library change, right? So it doesn't answer there. Okay that's what. So, but if I go back to the I know about. Yeah, I need to. So. You're fixed it. I've done it. You memories. What entries that? Yeah. If you look like this. get that thing right right, that what change you see. So there are three places. Three, right? There's H band, a band. This is the inia span. This is our band, right? But there is a, say, hello, the name of the span, is here. So there is a attribute, word. least. Notice five.is fine is signized 54, 995 EA. Is that the next? This transponding to the 4. Name all the thing, name on the thing inside the form from my instr, right? So that span as a fan ID, which is 994 That is the span of the first. So it comes to the worst way, okay, because log here and put the log, a boy. So this is the first patch, so this is the first band that' to, the first p thing that is this function. So this function, they say hello, the name of they say hello, right? So this is this, say hello. There's the face ID, there's a span ID, there's no pass ID because there is a starting span. and alribute two. 2 is the name of the attribute and value, you know, say hello. What is this in? That is say hello, that is a name. Oh sorry. is the word. Now, the next one, right? Next band, the nameos Spanish woman. So that plan is here. Okay. So that is format. So that is, so it has both of the same price ID, right? Both of the same ID. 0 access to L 08, right? Zeroids 2 ending this. But because a different span, right? And that's sp as a par, which is the same as spin. Now the third one, third is span, we named Print, right? So that sp is here. The Printter has a sold par ID, but it's par is against this. Why is this? Because the baby instrumental, right? These two, these two even some paradise. Because within this this functionalording these two, not that it's not that print is a format is one of the fire industry, right? Rather, whole format, string, and full, are are having p are same. That's how we're instrumented, right? So these are two of these schools for this span. So you see that both these fans format, as well as pre, there are the par, as the. So, this is our you've got an idea, right? How the instrument rate, how we will look like. It' pass. So this is something matter of going, how many aation, right? If you want to from respond, what is the thinking, right? And parameter the everything can collect through these places. Then you take that output and then send it to a b for what. Then take that output, then send that to whatever our detailing. that is how it. Sorry about this. You know, I didn't change this yesterday, because one month the whole day I used this one focus that I' actually give the sports in my office for my, you know, 500600 company employees across the world. So I use the same thing for this time each world in now. So which one you, eh? I didn't anything. I didn't the versions were changed. There was something. The lab or motion change. So that's what. I it? Yeah, you used too different. Uses the chasing and use the chasing and the kind of working they have some people. Yeah, I don't know, yeah, maybe you like to No, but I need this. So what I is part of opportunity, right? Yeah, you. Conticted it? No, I don't think so, I did this. I generated this court, see?ir. Oh, this? Tracy,. Yeah, so good doesn't in the when I, I. When I was swiming that you now, but something has going to change, I. But you guys can also sit now, you. Okay. So to decor, right? So Okay. So I just started to give ideas. This is. So what are the other flavables available, right, apart from, is this f to use this? It's not necessarily.. Everything is little bit, I think that's because I did not do the sing. When didn't we start the program this week? No, no. It's not that it. Okay, now. So distribute idea of are other other frameles of right, very well. So over is the kind of standard, okay? And Oper is product built on of military. So there are a lot of frameworks they choose oper telebately standard and provide libilities for tracing. So the power are not or the finished, Land fuse, and so these are oper delivery standard. Then land spin is actually a provided by lacte. So lin has an indic framework for craft. So that beaut before use landscape. So if you're building a land graph based agent, then easy to instrument your opera of your officer oppility using last.. Then that is not exactly built on top of operatillary standard, but you can get farsers, or third party, libraries to convert into open source, open delivery standard, and export that lo into some UI, right, which different standard. I Phoenix and Rus, they completely support of a d standard, so you don't need the party into time. weighted by asses, there are their own is aty by D bricks. So if you're building your, you know, agency bricks, there are something about agent bricks. So it's completely it's built on of over the standards, so you can easily export the law. Then offer like the, then all again, open source, really platforms And these are also built on, you see, or standard. Okay, so you don't need to indential, you don't do a third party food to convert into the there this other like this for, D, not built on talk of not producing. understand it's your source frs which are. using elementary standard, majority of them. And some of them are not producing. So depending upon what age and framework you're using, to build your agent, and what observability dash sport you want to remove visualization, right, you can decide you know, what you know, observility framework you wanted to use to get your traces. Okay. So this is just will be useful for you because I'm sure, you know, you'll be building some ag in your project or your, you know, some of the whatever talk or whatever you're doing that. Because these days everybody is building agents left and right. So and most of these agents does not work, they break, and they all work in simple scenarios, but in real productions in areas, they all break. So to begin with, you need to debug them. So this officer will be very useful to look at the traces and find out, you know what is happening. Number two, all of those will have security issues, right? None of the agents are secured by default. So if you just deploy the agents tomorrow, somebody will hack it and then, you know, your enterprise will allow a lot damage. So you need to secure. So for security purpos, also, you know, these places will be useful. There are many many fields in that we can figure out, for example, if somebody did a prompt injection, right? Or jailbreaking, right? You can look at the trace and see what happened, right? So this is going to be very important, you know? I'm sure many of you will come across useful loss of this. That's why I thought I' teach this as a kind of classes. So now. Okay, so what are the, you know, so we're really interviews. Bef, if you agents using, you know, AWs or DCP or Azio, right? So generally, all of them support standard. Okay, there no issue. And Amazon has something more slowwise. Flower white is the, if you build on Amazon, right, you can go to cloud watch and see your operation. There are two things in Amazon. Cloud Watch and cloud trade. So cloud Traway captured all the user action, something like if you create an agent, or if you rename an agent, or if you set agent permission, all that, so what are users do on AWU Resources? They're not captured. Cloud 3 But whatever happened inside an agent, suppose you send a query and return a response, right? Or rag application or anything, right? What are happened inside an agent? Those are captured in cloud Watch? So that means those trace ID fans will be there? Yeah, on the trace ID I think. So Trace ID, also, you'll see it in, for example, some all the application, some things will get captured also in cloud trail. Okay, but the detail of what happened mainly captured in cloud, then there is no way use of coding it hardcore then. It's already there. But depends Yes, a difference on how build. For example, if you build the agent, you go to Amazon, UI and create an agent. So in Amazon, there are three ways of creating agent. One is that you can use the two ways ID. One is that you can use their UY and create an agent. Or you built an agent using an ST gate like str or cruA orang or whatever. In your laptop, then you deploy in Amazon using Amazon Agent Core. In that case, you need to code. Okay, but that log, the trace, will come in cloud and cloud. You understand? Okay, so where it come? Then you can open it and see the trees. That's what it is. But what do you want to see there, you need to install it. But there is, of course, there is a water instcrimination on different level you. There's also an auto instcrimination, or you can answer instrument that we exam that's up to the door. But even if you don't do any instrumentation, cloud will gap will to create an agent. Suppose you want to create a militia agent. Then you want minimum visibility, right? Still, cloud tri will capture that you created an ag. Okay, but it'll not probably capture what happened during that ag. So there's a certain level and certain metrix Amazon automatically captures. So there are certain things you capture by default, but things like beyondiety trace are Rostan, get all the span, everything. And if you want to log yourself to put that, you would be inst. So that's plenty. Okay. Okay, so this is about the logging framework. So now I ask about. Okay. So now I want to hold something called Ibar paper. So I told you so far, what I told you is support how to capture the laws so that you can do evaluation. Okay, now I'm going to talk about some framework do actually evaluation. which I mentioned last time. So these frameworks make it easy for you. Okay. So what about the things for that? GR? Okay. So G is a framework the point Microsoft research. So what they did was that this sort of this sort extended the method. Okay. Int us kind of a little bit standardized that Las a judge method. So in the G store is in and what is for that probability is going. So the idea is this. So remember, right, earlier when we did the Elama judge, for example, let's say you have a summary, and you want to evaluate the summary in the scale of one to three. So one is this, two is this three, is this. Okay. So is there one day, let's say, summary is coherent, but not complete. Two is coherent and complete, like that we give some rubric, right? So it'll just give you a score of one, two, three, like that, right? But you probably want to kind of numerical score, right, not just indeger. Also, every time if you want to write these rates, right, step by steps. So what it came up with is that if you just do a task, so what does G, what does in that?. So let's say give an example. You would be given one summary is written for a new. You will task is to write the summary you want to one kind of scale. Just give this. Okay. And you just give some very valuation So you give the saying. Now, what this framework doesn't additionally that it creates automatically a chain of thoughtsteps for LO. Okay, it will say, you know, things step by step, then do this, do this, do that will create that, chain of thought steps. That is one thing. Okay. So, secondly, see what example, right? It's say, in this case, right? What are the tasks can be one example is done for example? your task is great to summary age.. And art is you provide the U here, then you get the newation steps. Okay. This is make the table. First, the new artical by the main topic at three points. Okay. Second, read the summmary and compare to the new subject. Check with the summmary of the main topic and 3. And if you present them and it presents them in it clear order, step three, as this is on a scale, one to 10 is the low and highest five, what is is, what is that this eval the state of thought, right? This is provided by the div. That's one thing. Other thing what it does is that it takes this water score for it, one four, 405, whatever, right. Then in in so what actually went Elam, UN output one, right? It is not always used one. In the sense, if you put temperature not zero in your, right? So you actually, it produce all the tocins, but with certain probty. That's how generative models work, right? So next token. So one is actually a token. produce an output. So there is that's a maximum probability token. right? So it also has token for two, three, four, five, with low, much lower property. Okay, that's why it's giving us for one. It means that it is producing the token, one with the highest property. So what this frivor does that actually when you query L, right, actually you can get all the tokens with the properties. If you query that kind of right, when you send the IP request, you can get the token probability for each token.? Then the G frame take the each score as co. Multiply by the token propability and take an average. Soutemary score. So why are you doing it? So this gives a more robust mission, because you don't know what is the confidence by which El is saying this score is one. Maybe if you run that 10 times right, let's the temperature is like 0.2 or something if you run it 10 times, maybe eight times it'll give one one times maybe two, right another time maybe three. You don't know, right? So to get this sense of what is the confidence value of L 11, giving blood, or what other score is giving, right? This metri will. Let's. So this is the. This is the, you know, additional things, the G1 proposes on top of LLM as a. Okay. Then, so this is a framework. Okay, this is just a framework. So the population is fd, then, why there this deep pivad. Okay, so this is one friend. Okay. So this is one frame two, which is there, pro L. There is another paper came from. I think it's from my interviews for Nadas. So the Radas f Okay, so this is our as I mentioned, right? This is a valuation of for de. Take the to, with the of topper, and some glass is a good. The not exclusively for generation... So it came up with the three minutes. This is the paper. I' to. So this paper came from a UK. And T in UK, so they came up with the three bridges on in Iraq. What is for a faithful? So faithful measures, whether the cake delated in the answer can be supported by the context. So if basically actually check in anucination in subses. Okay, so there is a context from here and there is a respon generator, right? So is there any haucination happening by the alarm? Okay. So it will compare this with the text. That's what is happening there. Okay. Yeah. I is one thing is intig the order matters. It's more like in the beginning of the end. into LM, technically in order. If you order, it gives different importance to the decision. That is true. That's true. It gives the beginning are more important. Yeah, that is true. I agree. But I'm not talking about that. I'm saying So your context is so you are saying that context comes before input or after, right? So usually I don't know how it is arranged, but so yes, so if the partic is very law, it may grow in the middle of the context. But still, it is notate. It will be something, right? So I agree. So maybe because there's no proper context with say anything. But you wanted to mention the Harris. Maybe the reason is that your context is too big, you wanted to change the order or you want to make a small likely. Okay. So that is a cause, but we want to mess around as a result of that, is it fascinating? So what it check is that it check each statement from this. It's takes the final summary of. Take each statement from this and verify the statement is there in the context. Whether it's referring to that. Okay, then it takes the fraction of the statement, which here to that, that fraction is faithful to. Okay. So what the Jet? Jet g extract individual statement from the generated act of the spelling from ve statement against the context is calculated statements, the number of statements. In the in this response. For example, if you are summary, use summary as five sentences, of the five sentences, it verified, you, four sentences against context. is your. Okay. No? The second letter to this report answer theiverse. P whether the generated respon directly as the. So what is that it does slightly different. So you want to now comparepond to the original positive. Okay, is the cancer is rel to the company. Okay. So, so he's not talking about heucination, but is it is asking whether they answer is slightly different than what you are asking, right? So what it is that it takes the answer and generate possible questions that for this for those des. So it does an inverse process. Take the final summary and generate your work, you know, or take it post. For example, it is more useful in personality. Text answer and generate possible questions for this answer. Then it calcul the similarity between each of those questions and the original question. That average similarity is the answer. So, L was given the answer, was between the So at that average, that is the answerologist. So there's a bit kind of, you know, countant you, but it sort of makes sense, right? If your answer is better relevant, then what happens is that most of the post, right, will be very similar to the post. that's. Then the third met is for protes. how measures, how 11 the potness is for answer So here does it that snacks the. Okay, so this is slightly different from the faith rola answer. In the faithfulness answer, we are looking at each sentence from this final answer, and checking is it supported in the context? Is it any consistent? Is there anything which is saying which is not the other context? That's. Here we are looking at the context itself, right? You take you break the context, you take each sentences in the context, and see, if the sentences is a refer from answering it. Maybe the context is review out a j. Okay, so maybe the port is between ten sentences. Out of it's only one is renewed for answering. So this is this is referring to some kind of a one is like precional, like a called, okay? Is this a retrieval is? Oh, yeah. What if the LLM generates the answer anyway? Then is accounted as a hallucination, even if the answer is right? So your contacts, you have like one correct sentence there. But LLM is still generated dancer. So is that? Yeah it's the answer is relevant it is useful, right? But it's not relevant to the context. It's generated with elements.. Yeah, so that we' captured by the faithfulness, right? So, I didn't understand I'm saying that so it compares the response with the context? No. So what is this? It takes, let's say the context has 10 sentences.. Then it look at the answer, and see, if this So it use this particular first sentence. Okay. The first tendency is there in this answer. So we know that the original, not. Originalum use this particular mindful generating that. Now your questioning is that it is generating without. So in that case, you don't know. It's using on the protection. So here are taking auations. Where is values, used in situations where the LLum don't know the context, right? For example, your company internal documents. Exactly. Right? In that cases, LLum, if it generate some answers,ination. But if generate a correct answer, then we know that it is using this context. Now, the remaining sentences, which is not that any mention of this year. Right? So that means they are not very useful for that. So your context is generating. So how do you fix it? So. So you proud proud of return less number of this thing or you will you reveorize? Reetory so that you get better context right. So this is taking you out arieval. Trival is. So this is taking hallucination. So one is taking hallucination... Is it clear? She was it? So, has a run this things like this all these days. Okay. Okay, so this is two attic papers. What is this as I mentioned, the G framework from Microsoft and member, Liz Academy. Then this company called Deep P? They took these and you know, created a python library, a sources library, which you can download and use it in youration where these, you know, these ventrics, right?as metrics or Europe G metrics, right? And plus above 30 plus 11age metrics are there, infin, so you can just qual them again, like a plug in break and fall. And they also have, you know, ability to do generate syntic data, everyility to do red timing. Okay. You can check for jailbreade, a lot of things. Okay. So these fers, if you want to do any evaluation. So the reason I'm teaching all this because I expect all of you in your LLM application, do some level of evaluation. I'll ask that when you finally show me a prototype at the end of presentation. If you guys are rot and properly ev valuation, I'll not give you, you know, full credit. So I expect all of you to do some level of evaluation depend upon your application, your fing, and you can use DPR framework. Okay that's why I'm teaching all these. Okay, and you can use, whatever is even better something, you know, that you, I think you will support that. So that you will essentially, you know, create some kind of that, right? And it's kind of grader three, but, you know, you can make this testing a little bit more logical. Okay. So See, for example, a single prop score, you give us rubric right to the as are right. Score zero of the summer in the see any of the head. So you space for example, you wanted to summarize that, T session. Okay. And the criteria is that the smarish claver hinding inl. So that's your original supposed to. generating the summermary of your chat session. Now, the event for evaluating the summary you're asking at JLant evaluate in the score of zero zero summary is summary. This is 14. Sc is two in themary has all the recession, but are the wrong order. Score is if themary has allered, and there is the order, right? So this is how you feel back? You are rubring in. And Jwal is step son, you know, Joord and then the school, whatever they should. Where Daddy was with a little bit can you, you basically a bit more structure. So is that extract endings the natural or good? That's a summary for me. If it is, if it is true, are the that are the conclusion. Now you have a different choices then all out of order, yes, so you can give intermediate for two, four and. Okay. So you can give this bit more, like a logical flow, right? Youense condition, you can give little bit more stuff. eval criteria, the di about. Okay, saying it's in plain text like this. Right? Here is like three sent answers. Okay, you put our said, you know, if if it contain all the three sections, but two sections are whatever, you could have written there in that plain text, but that will make it more easy. Okay. So you can give more evaluation that's it. So yeah. Then there are, you, if you are using range, right, there are metrics like maze for ears next to maze vibration. Multipod contest for 11 if you want to safety, your toxicity, or. So are in DR. That's why I'm saying. Okay, you can it for that use. Okay. So before we. So again, I' running to break. So you said, you not a segment for you, right? You download this, and you know, try it in your as a group. Okay. And if you don't have any of the HI or any of the LLM EVAs, you can use Oama, and installed Gemma Oama model and do it. It' work that maybe I for a, okay? So I strongly encourage you to go through this two notebooks and run in, because number one reason, you allowedlement in your project. Okay, number two reason, right? basically understanding this is very important, because all of you will be working on some GA application future. Right. And revir will be very important. so you give me a. So about it as product is. Last year, you moved Europe, Pol in with us. One you did. they had to be the whole. So I did want to. And so at least when we go with weure that it's always. What do you start for our project? So. Yeah, exactly. We can do it as a backhand, right? the task.. installed Lra and then get the FBI from any of anI F it to Langrah and then modify Lraph prompts and codes and everything and let let it make a report. Is there any picture there? Have you looked at Langra? Is there any picture that generous PDM or something? So how are you going to generate the PH? Differenterent package. The thing is that one of the Asians are supposed to be the report, right? it will have its report. How have we done to see trying to use it?'s something like Sep are cooling. They apply I was talking about. So they apply the Korean residues. They create resum. After it Korean resume, like, it can create X. So the create like this, PDF or X or something. could use like tools. So you're saying that agent will just display it as a raw data. don't It's not raw, you' be like Jason. Jason, right? So you can take Jason and format into H table. Okay, so... All they have to do is you already have to report eachT and he print it, it'll just the HTM Okay, so that's it for okay? Little. Okay. Any questions? Any questions? All right? Okay, so we will take a break. 7:30 will meet and just part of before you guys sleep, how many of you have update today? Nobody? No t? Okay, so this is beginning of five, but next week, I will, whether you late or not, I'll meet out of you. Okay. So today's snow, so I don't want to takeenance for that, so, but next week, onwards, I'll start taking attendance during, not for theory, I'll take attendance for the 10% weightage for particification and the and consultation. So today I will leave and the next week you know, I'll start? Are we?. First is 7:30 I' just send an email. Okay, we get something done, we don't know. We are just planning a lot to do we're having a meeting actually showing him what we can do during the weekend, we can study laying, downloading of my computer's new, I can install it. Everyone has new one. All of us actually, we install language. We' gonna do it over the weekend, okay? All of us, we installed Langra. and create something. Like, do a demo. Do a demo, fl? Like that must have some sort of demos, It doesn't have to be our product. We can just do anything. demo, can show him that we started to double up the back and Anybody from Okay, so what was it? Anybody from the.. Ottama Police project, John.... So, I still think. I't. No,.s, the labs? Yeah, because of inex experience. No, we just want to show him that we are working on it. Yeah, We all up, and we go back to our architecture, you, we created the our presentation. So we did Langngram, we needed database. back to database. We was decide, you know we downloading. So we have to do some to start on this. Is it mention the scope? The dat You have to have it. Otherwise, how you going to keep the record of your report? Any record.. But the agent weries the data, it's supposed to say somewhere. D. Hey, so you have to find their database, which one you doing on our ears.. Post? Yeah. We are done. There's no meeting today. What happened, H? And they are. No big? Pro. what will you during this day? Not a gap. Because I would force you to do again in September. 4 you to the match. Indian. Are you able to?ative condition that you have to be full time? Like itisa. We have you to be. Who? Nobody cares anyways. Unless. there report?. Let's. I found an academic played two days ago. told me to do that same. to write the appeal. No, I know, but they were never to write something that that's it I don't. She told me that C zero four hours. Not C She says for the. When you look at even in this semester, you have the bon is theories. Yeah, specifically. What I'm saying, how can you she said she didn't give the vot?.., this. I told you that I have not submitted on right space. because I didn't want the answers that didn't told with the do it correctly.. The bad.mitted it, but then I told that and then because I got the answers and all, then she told me that it's okay. If you feel this consider this assignment. Have you the practical? No, not practical. No,. How that would that. She didn't today. So it's TV, okay? So he got his TV. How much? Yeah,. And she didn't give me marks of aignment1. That's why I answ. I question? how much. She made her 20. She didn't give bers for for the individual comers, right? Now his secret she did it.. He had in 195. So with 1. point, he cleared that. Now, one of the asend she didn't mark, that's right. Even this
