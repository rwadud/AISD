But with deeping, they have came to grow creating their features in general of as representation in. For example, if you take a deep blood in water, take, you. Different layers of convolution and pulling things like that. And bl of these features, right? Very r, you know, just. But then if you go if you to the father downstream cricket model there, then what happens, the model itself, you is not in transation. You have these these features like the edges four years over the paper, which feature. start up here. excel the various internal transformations, not transformation. The model itself create in generalation, higher order theation, like features. Hence, these days, which particularly for data, you go in data, but it as part of the modern training it's internally develop. That's one of the big advant deeper. This is for audio, as well. With some extent, text, right? In text earlier people prod used to create features like bagram, trigraph,, right? And people prod used to use synonyms to replace, you know some of the things and things like that. So people used to you know, like kind of future engineering, even in text. But these days with, you know, platformer models and representations like embodying, right? So it was that that numer killed representation, right? Once you have the nurication, in the liberateers, right? When the representation, for data, these days, nobody much create features because pretty much once you toize it and use any kind of, you know, any kind of embedding type of representation, like, if you just use the embody that. For example, if you want a sentiment analysis, right, you find you have some model like with some, you, cent analysis, examples and just use the e that will work job. But then why do you feature in the day I'm going to talk about you want now with that You need to understand that of industry they don't use because various reasons, because learning industries require to explain the results. For example, it is mandatory that ine or financial institutions, when somebody apply for a low mortgage loan, or credit loor. You need to explain why that score or mortgage was rejected. So if you just use a model, you may not have enough explainable explainability. Similarly, if you in cybercity, right, if you need to explain to the panalyst of the statewater, why this an attack. This particular user seems to be suspicious, right? And so a lot of various research, included don't use interning models in various domains. And also if you look at typically data like data, where you get logs, a lot of logs these kind of automatic features ising does not work because it's four lo the software. have a lot of fields, nest fields we need to the and there is the schema and then, you know, make some transformations. and you want to somergations becauses are produce continuous, right? There will be a lot of. So in various domains like that, you know, you deal with the log data, if you deal with a lot of data related to FAC healthcare, you really don't reduce the modelels or the time of data deal with, you know, it still require feature anything. Okay, so is still still important, I use. So just because of the empoding models are there doesn't mean that they use that a labour avoid feature engineers. So, just because of examples of people use earlier, the original text I have a dog, please, right? So you then use someraries like, you and thenK natural language to kids. So you take remove some of the stock. The stock words are like A appears in almost every text, right? So they are notative. They don't cut any information. If you remove that you invented words like, I love dog, is sleeping, Now, this are the problem because there words in there could be another textbooks, by saying, I have a dog he left just now, right? So sleeping slept, sleep, all this one the t. So you removed this kind of lammitization, you remove these this characters, then keep the root of the word. So you convert this simple, I have a dog is the contraction. I have a dog. The killer keys that most of you name keys. punctational, I have. The is convert this capital case of Isra case.. Then you do organization, I have. So after this, we can' convert this to the bottom. So the simple, I have dog, I have my dog. So I have, I have dog, dog. So this is just features for. Yeah, so I' when we talked about and yesterday. And one thing I was wondering about, you have a different, example, I have a dog, I have a dog, he is sweet. So the impression is he, you don't know him necessarily, if he's a dog or someone else. And you need, maybe you need more cont. Yeah, so that if we give an example, you that you through a friend's house and you see I'm with my friend, he's, I go. And the key is a friendly dog, I'm I'm only saying that these days you don't do this kind of, for the same. Yeah, what to do with that after organization, you still do organization. So organizations that are. And that's. Then what you believe that's the en. Yeah, about any. It's just un. I the words into some words. Then you just to because you need to have have probably. You and the right. No,. What I mean is people to have sex. But we need some. Yes, that's. Yeah, so you've got too much. For example. Even it's too much's, a smart. Very. sounds like, you know, you're hurting something more. You're running. you? You know. require thatain enments like only ways. You made special. But generation, you just sat there. That's. People. matching. And this is similar to when have his and you have a place. No. You're getting. about what kind of I want. You want to use. What do you want to use?. the word we cover within this one sentence. Yes, so do you a person that's. But you to the future grounds or you a person soft way. I'm saying that is a superior is they capture you know more c. understanding all of. Whereas's don't capture. For example, it's a speed, to give someone other word,.? That if you use thatated studio, this. No. Oneitional context isitional. You need to. Answerly. So what I'm saying that, you know, text this used to be the way it produced to L. Okay? But today, people organization, organization that are standard level for organization. Then you just use in a more nrical of the situation like everybody.'s more But of course, you learned the things like there's a library called from Meta, right? Fast..um. Not fast enough. So there's a lab report classification, that classification. Let's still use this room. If you want to do very fast classification, right, use that. that is based on text and fast. For speedwise, maybe this is as possible.. So I was just show you an example of. I would create to create a future engineering in a very tradition being like. So now we are talking about something else, which is before your roof each, you might have to do this same value and. Because this is, again, very, very important issue, missing values arise because particularly in various scenarios, right? For example, if you looking at analyzing surveys, right? It's possible that people don't all the field, right? Because they don't want to give that information or for various reasons. So you are a lot of. Then you think of laws, logs from, you, IOD devices, logs from your, you know, endpointpoint agents. So, what happens is that these logs are, you, they correct for locally, and once in a while when the ber is full, they push it to the clock. That's how they drive the wrong. Now, it's possible that sometime they sample the gloves. The don't send out the logs or they, at this time of sending the logs, especially, you know, our might and this other, the data does not talkfully. Okay, so you know a lot of missing rows or missing brand all that can happen. So So the missing value treatment is a very important aspect, particularly dealing with customer data and. So there are three ways of handling these water. There are three type of missing varies. So this is for missing completely random, missing at random and missing not at random. Okay. So this has to do with the you know, whether these missing values are dependent on other or or you, other rows and things like that. So what is the same completely random means is that yeah. So what means is that So what this age is this, right? So that is not related to, you know, whether your gender or, you know, whether you're income and something, right. So, for example, it's possible that is known that, right? For example, you know, one particular gender, they probably one disclose their age so much right. So, what is going to pro that then if you from that tender, right? may not dispose at age. So that case is not a completely. So in that case, it is, you know, at Atlanta, the property of a value being missing is related to other obsolved buildings in the data system. Okay, but not to the value of the missing data is. Or, for example, if I have a certain illness. Right? Then I cannot disclose my, you know, some of my medicalical medical status, right? Or something like they ask me, what's my, you know, in a healthcare person, right? What's my blood pressure or some kind of person? If I have some disease, I'm not disclosed, right? So, whenever you, yeah. So results to the issue, like, as an example, for age where there may be in some cases, it's random within the gender, whether it a company of age. Like, maybe some people who are one day or something who don't one and that random, but hopefully they're not random. Yeah, so there's dependent on gender, but also. Yeah. So what I'm saying, yes. So what are you saying that the is not one? I guess. Or like. I like people who are for, maybe they have heart getting medical have that is one of the. I think it was M money, theamples it in the MR MRach and in that case, that not. So this this one pass that's separate and it's an interaction with a brand new terms, but the other one is not right.. So it's a bit more complicated. Yeah, it's complicator. It's. What I'm saying is that than some correlation between a missing data and an obser that correlation is not to be perfect here and might be to be partially, in all those cases, you classify is as, missing, I'm impression is that into this? regression. Oh, I see. Have you heard that? No. You basically say or no? And how do you that's theress. If no, a different. That's.'s similar. Maybe a lot of these complicated. Yeah. So then there is the third class, which is missing not a class. Okay. So that case is basically the property of land missing, is related to the missing one himself. Okay. Well, I'll give you an example for that. So, this is probably for example, right? Yeah, I don't know. For example, the income is the same, right? Then it's like high income people may not want to disclose their income. Or low income people may disclose. So it depends upon that missing value itself, not related to any other. So the depend is that value of that vari. So that is called busy., it is theing it is missing a Atlanta is not related to anything, whether not related to itself or not related to any other problems, it is called missing. Okay, so a little confusing technology, but you know, you need to keep this in mind. Okay. Then it more complex pre as, you know. So, given some examples here, we seem completely a grand. Okay. It is survey of transpondence accidentally skip it to about their favourite colour. D of printing around some forms. Okay. So the printing I have nothing to do with that for some period is age or what? So it's completely a. So that is an example of that. Now, in Atlanta example in the medical study, younger participants are more veryucedly theome power, the participants are recorded. So the mischieveness of incerence of some age, not on the incval. So younger people they don't report their income is low or whatever things, not. In the survey, people with severeion are less likely to answer questions about theirental st. Makes sense, right? So that is because the value difference for the state, the value of the freed itself. So it's very easy to do. a missing value does not anything is completely. If the missing another, it's missing at random. If it g the p that itself, it is that So that's about missing values. Now, how hand you missing values right? So you get out things like p delation, r delation, you can delete the inact. For example, you know, you could delete that of age and mental status, right? But all you could delete some res, like row one row three, row, six, etet. That's one options. But this you should do or leave. There are very, very few for roasts. Usually, they have of there will be more rose compared to the photos. Any data, right? Any good data. So if you up missing, then it's okay otherwise, you know, it can be require rose. It should never do. Okay. So that's not a good suggestion. There it can impute, right? It can replace the data with you know, if it's aum the data, right? between more or again, it's an order data. You can replace it with some kind of interpation, right? Or that is possible. But that can lead to a lot of problems, because one problem is that it can create some bias in the data because in order to interpolation depends upon what are the percentage of other data, right? If they're not more other data, right? So for example, let's say in this case, here you see, you know, the steamome, right? income cover is $50, right? There's only one income which is 10,000. Maybe if you replace four and five, with that they have mean or you know mode or doing interation, right? It may you buy us, because those virus are high, right? Maybe four foreign five income, maybe 5,000. So you can create some kind of, you know, biosis in the data. But this is often used in the sub sense, which is better than including dation. probably can cause, because why because when you do anything like this interpation, you are created some differentency. right? Between the data. Let's say you doing the question. income law foreign using something. also some kind of meanwhile, right? Then meanwhile it's different upon other values. N, let's say you play, use this data for creating mute. The split, you know, data randomly necessity. And it also happened that these row came in the test data. Right? So now what is happening? The test data, right? You want to produce some labels, The label would be whether this person is, you know, let's say rich or poor. Some sound better or high or whatever, right? Suppose you want to use the sport on credit scoring or classification, right? This wasn't the data. But now you're creating a difference between creating a test, right? Some, some part of ideally the test data that should not be seen by the model, right? But the test data the identator should become completely independent, right? But why during this simulation is some individual training and. That can cause the moral to overlate your. What do we do implications separately within? Yeah, that's Absolutely. That's. So do you do with that should first do this splitting then, then splitting andain thus violation. Then within that you do that's more accurate. That's correct. So about things to take care of this? Okay, you Yeah, another thing, but for you need to do is when you do feature a very important thing is, what is called the feature scaling. So the feature scaling is important because helium, see, for example, right, the age. The age is, you know, the age, what, possoss zero to 200, maybe. Whereas income can go from you know, 10,000 or even a few thousands to 10, hundred thousands, right? So that rate is very huge, right? Whereas the number of children is always be single digious, right? Now, when you fast this models are you know, let's say recreational model or a classification model, the model don't know that understanding that you know, age is something more to go between these. So treat anything in the number, right? What if it's is a number? So that you see other estimate the model parameters, right? It can cause more errors. There's errors associated with the estimation of parameters of these, you know, can cause things like that. It's ideal to make all the variables in the same range. Okay, all we just in the same range. Allumerical features in the same range. Okay. So this is done by Tarius by moving it, but simple vari is proved. May cause in the 0 r or you variable convert into 0 1 range. So this can be done to using some simple scaling, right? So subtract the minimum value X value is the bottom for each each row, then divided by the max minus speed. So this transformation will convert to your features. human features and see. And of course, the catamoral features the ening, right one, one more, enc So this thing we should do. Yeah, so you can also do, you know, unf the into the other of you just getting used to convert them into some kind of a Gaussian distribution using what is called a f star formation. Because usually he assume that you know, the variable satisfy some kind of ding distribution. The noise satisfy you distribution particularly in you know, problems like, you know, the Christian.as in the Lity you've got, you know's in this distribut very few distribution. So if you see a few distributions like this if you are in, right, then it's better that you know I found the way to go closerution. So this is another 50 things to do say you do that. So that's the third is, you know, using theous values. Okay. Convert t into some kind of a buckets. For example, age, yeah. So this may be some issues here, if you see them on right, the end the right end and the far right end and the farther left the end, are higher, then give it to four. Yeah, so. So another one, there's a increase in an extreme value, but it's less noticeable and is there a risk that the error would increase in this it would be more important killing this place? No, would be more than the guy, it goes up the difference between back and the one next to it compared to the the left. So maybe is smaller. It's not an actor. Huh? It's not in the acter to be a tour. Hey, it's not doing. It's much better than doing this. Yes, it's part much better than. So, yeah, so the other thing is to convert Convert some of the numerical features into categorical features. Okay. By converting them into puckets. For example, age, right? Instead of using age, you create the bucket for ages, zero or t like that. Oh, it depends on your problem. You have five different bucket sizes. So that Because what happens is that when you take this stage, right? You see, age is not in this variable, actually, it's an integer, right? And you see in aulation, you don't see, you know, the second does a distribution for the age, so you don't see a typical sunway, for example, like this, you don't see a lot of values for each of the age, even if there's no missing data, right? So it's better to aggregate. So for example, you may see one or two cases for children age 1, two, three, five, like that. You may see a lot of ages like 30, 31, 40, 50, like kind of, right? Again, you don't seem much ages about 50, 60 like that. But if you convert into buckets, it's like, right? That sort of to reduce the noiseation and make that distribution be more smooth. Okay. So it's better, you know, and quantities like age, you know, Saturdays and sout converted into range. and converted into, you know, discrete quantities by you knowing this fields rather than, you know, sport quization for filling. So I that using theuced varium. Now, AK, back features, right? For example, there are things like I was a zip course. Brat the rot, right? IP versus is like almost typically infinity. So many Ieared this is possible. And if you keep them like that are not useful to do them or, you can. You know, that means you some kind of emperance. into some of emboding. So that is another thing. So. So this is what way to do that using weddings. So like embedd advantage that they will preserve semantics, particularly after the world to. You are figured out a way to convert this intoation. So basically, what embedding means you're not learn that it essentially youumerical vector of a fix exercise. So your words can be, you know, your sentence can be quite long, right? And sentence is composed of words. Okay. So for each word, you create a nuari a person. Okay. So here, for example, right, there's a sentence called. So let's say there's a cat, word cat, right? So cat So let's say you create an emppium of size, you know, one, two, three, four, five, six seven. Okay. So better like this. Okay. Now, you take a word, the k will allow bird numerousations that everybody will be very prose cats. So you see very fields, right, are very similar. We don't very close, but if you take something like house, right, that will be much different. So if you think as this is a numerical vector, right, in the space of that nrical vector, the words, which have similar meanings. They love, they will be frozen. Okay. So the algorithm which creates this tricular bding is constructed such that the value of the metal weight for words which are similar in meaning will be closer. It's magically similar. Similarly you see man who want, right? And King Kash, King entry, So the example, right? that you take the difference between man and king. You get the same difference as woman and queen. Okay, so this is because of that, you know, process and nature of. So beta meddics, there are people algorithms for creating vera meds. So this idea of what is ver body? A verding a very word will be converted into a numerical vector of fixer size. You can choose that size, whether it's 500 words, or 500 di vector or 10 diivers to winter. Typically there are a few hundred dimension ve there. Then you take a centence, then you to that, you can convert this NS sentence into one by take the embedding of each of the words in that, then do some kind ofing. You do a max cing or an average c and this other that. Basically, average automors, and then create one vector for. You can do. Or you can contact it, then but then you become a very large.s. So are today. Today is the most used, the presentation of words are features. As I mentioned that they say. The reason is, they preser catic relationship. Okay. So who appetence of birds which have similar meaning, there will be closer. Okay. So if you are model, you know, if your model is trained dog is in the word gap. When inference comes, there's the word kitten. It understands that it is talking about something similar to cat. And if something about house, it's very different. So this is a middle, there's a nice, if you want to learn more about, there's a nice, you know, media art class. Now, how to create this emb There are the different models. So the first model which came report 10 years ago, which created the first embedding convert model. So that model, what it does was that it had a small nural network, so that nural network you could create this task that you have a sentence that the sentence is this is the word, current word. This is the previous word, and this is the word previous to that. This is the next word, word next to that, right? So these are the words around that. So you predict this word. So give word the surrounding words, predict this word. So this is one, you know, what isinination, given a word where it is words. So they built that model for this purpose that it, it trades basically to a given surrounding where the word into the either you can do this way or can do this way. There's two different models. This is some background everybody is this one.. So both ways you can play and so so when you play this model, you know, that neural the middle layer, right? Soert a neural network with this is the input layer, ne layput there. So that layer, okay? So that's how you create this embody. So this is the workment model, then there's an improvement of that's from Stanford was the. So this was done by a graduation. Bl calls on the main. Some I. But then, the Stanford University came to the, then what Stanford was going vended, right? then because nowadays you Stanhom model particularly the birth, the birth transformer, the first transforming model direct for Google, right? biirectional, you know, encoding former situation. So that it can be used for. created like that train that on the world and choose some layers typically the last layer will be typically, you, logistic kind of you know, a layer, which convert the into some kind of property into various vases. So don't take the final layer, but take one layer before the final layer, that layer will be a numerical layer. The last layer will be la layer that convert into some of, you know, prob 4 inch glass type of thing. So don't take the last. If you take one l from the last, that layer hit the l usebody. So today, for example, the lot of embedding models, if you if you guys are familiar with the hun face, you guys can download all your downloaders from h Face, right? So there are separate tab for embeding models. In fact, there is also a clear for embedding. So look at there, you see things like, snowfling one of the feeding anding models these days, or even from Alib Baba Ibre model. So you can just like upload LL models, Elama or you know,ma, right? Open source. There are open source embedic models available on. So you can download one of the latest embodying orders for your, you for your tasks. So just one so you will example you wait, It's called MT. Massive Emb model. Yeah, can see, you know. I see here now. This is the one I think need now.. This are very p. 4096 means that you are embedding vector of dimension 409, which is very cheap. you don't that you want something just more and putting, maybe less than still here that's So you can't chooseending you, you know?. So the white ey from there is no fake. this is one of the ones, right? There are only thousand. We were the island on. Yeah, you went right, this big one. You see something here. G on. Yeah, so we can, you know, go to a. something which is like dimensional less than a thousand you don't want very high. So if you use the higher weddings, your problem are not require but your computational your will become. You. That's. And this constantly the mem Okay, now? I'm talking about Dash. Okay. So this is very important, why is it important? Because. So as I said, didn't train the model, right? It is important that you pick the data into training valuation and test, right? And it's important that the validation and test data are should not have any, you know, any information on any data which is part of the training set. And so it's possible that, you know, sometime, without knowing that happens, and you wouldn't know that it's happened to me many times that you know, we did this, but at the end of the day, you see model is doing very good. you don't expect it to do that well and all very test it in production, the performance is going down. That partly because there is a. Now can happen various reasons. What is for because the feature, which is sort of aggregate of another feature or another variable, and that can also temporal connection. An example is you? Suppose you have a model, right? which you want to print it here. But then in that model you have a feature for what is model. Right? So when you calculate, you are what happens with that the salary? So you create your daily data and you have this early salary, right? Then you, at some point, you use that every salary, right? for predicting. Then so this monthly salary. So yearly Saturdayary to calculatesgreg Then if you use monthly salary as you are invariable, that can some information about the something, right? So that is not I.. Sometime what happens, there could be duplicate data in the without knowing when you do the training test, some part of the duplicate data one data will come into the training data set and do the test data. The other is because the data has the time difference. So that is similar to what you are doing in the case of interparation, right? Because when you do the phys operation, you grade in dependency between that value of the previous value. So in the time it's you know that when you time is data, you should never do you know, grant a spitting. You should always put time series model in whenever you want to test time series model, you should always go spitting based on time, You create up to some time, use it for training, then from that time to some kind of windowator as for varietation, then from that point to a later time, right? as for testing. So you should always do because the time in this data does not adhere to the identically and independent social data. There's always dependency between usually there's a dependence between, you know, up to some some kind of a type autation. So if you do a sping overtime in this data randomly, you can create a. Because the samples are not. So these are the three, four reasons you are again, because this is important because you don't address this some you may see a good performance of your model, but at that end of the day when you test the model after wrong life, right, if you, you see that it is not actually doing well. It was doing well, developed, because they delegated, not because of the. This is very important. Yeah. So this is a processes of. We saw filling in this before spreading. E said, you should sp the tet improve, you know, train test validation, then do the value implication, not implicate the force building Okay, so first you removelicate the sp, don't do the other way, okay? Staying for another reason. When you created that Bob C's transformation, that again, creating the dependency. So you should not do Bob's co transformation and then spl into climate. You should sp dig into tth as well then do box box transformation. Sprinting 94 litres data, random minstro spitting website. Okay. And things like that. Okay, there would be some kind of, you know, part of a private school. So these are sounds, keep in mind, when you I' How did you take data measure the coration between each feature and target? If some features are highly cated metic then you need to suspect. Maybe not really correlation when we do to some data. So all in camp was. Yeah, and the tempor Coration between train and. So the temporate formation is measured using a function for autoration. Basically, you take a row and take a row same value of the on a row, let's say after T T points later, T time min later, right? So or less between X and T and xR T plus t, compute this quantity as of the bro functional top. If you see that you know, there's an auto operation. And then you should, you know, so you can identify a time scale within which the coration so that's that is moderation. Yeah. Okay, so that the last topic you are going to recovered today's feature selection. So, okay, so now that you now do engineer a lot of features, right, by, you know, doing, you know, empty creating, emptying or doing chemo, standard feature engine in techniques, or not, things like that. Then generally people say more features are good because more signals are good, rate. MLs are about, you know, combining a lot of signals. But then the problem is that too many features are also not good. because you need enough data to support that. So if you are more features than the data, right it can cause moreitting. It comes from many simple, you know, made understanding of metrics, right? Met, right? met when you are learned, you learned in school, right? in linear arbra, right? When you go, met recom, right? When you, the number of ros is less than a number of fours is more than a number of rows, right? You do not get a good fer for the. So number of features compared with the number of you, observations, can lead to more for the product. You don't have enough stles to enough to fit that model that. Okay. So that is one reason. And memories the features are to be stored in memory, right? So if you use too many features, it may grow more computational resources, like memory. And more features also means that, you, when you send one for inference, right, it is to fetch all the features, it has compute using all the features. It can increase theatings.. And more features also data. So you want to keep holding optimimum number of features for your model. Even though you back three, you may be able to create large number of models, or large number of features. You want to keep on features for your model. So use some for feature selection. You select the best features. It should keep you all the features. Keep the best features. So how do you build the features selection? The two things you know, two factors you the concern by doing this in the is that feature important to the model. For example, when I add that feature to the model, it increasing its, you know, acuracy or whatever you want to mention the performance, right? I build that model without the feature, I build that model with the feature. Is the difference is substantial Then I need to keep the feature. Okay, during the development. The one thing that is that feature helping me to generalize better means that when I, I developed this model, but then I am going to use it in production. That means it is going to in make inference or new data and see data, right? In the case unseen data, we know the distribution going to be very different, right? We may start seeing data, which is not part of the data, right? So if you want the model to be also generalized well. Should we perform very lot and see data, right? So you in, you know,. So what happens is that features may be doing good as a part of your training and test that or training and validization sets. But when you start using it for the test set, right? I' data, it may not do that well. So it keeps this in mind, not just enough that it is you know, making the development, you know, model during development is enough. You need to make sure that they are also generalize. So there is So how do you improve this you know, how do you select this? So what are the various ways of? feature selection. You know, you can do some kind of altropic kind of method, so you, you know, you make you do the systematically, right? You start with one feature, right? Then you add another feature and see, you know. So you' lessons a suppose zero of ten features. You start with the model with one met. Then from the reviving nine features, right, you add one by one, and see which one, is increasing the, you know, accuracy. So then you have two features. Then you, you, eight features remaining, again, you will do that. So you do recursingly. Okay. So you can do either forward that you start with the one and a head, four features, or you start with all the features and producing features. Again, the curly one by. So that's the standard one way of going. interact comb That is another feature. That's another feature. So if you mortalize that feature, how do you know you has infinite number of combinations on? Like if you have anyone have an endorial. Yeah, so end in. Yes, so what about the features that you never go to feature direction? You want to go really But the other cases like, you find you know from the dominic experiences. That's why a lot of domain experiences. These features don't don't coordinate or they don't come time make this thing. Other technically, you want to create all life and then you. So be also like you have modles you need tend to follow you which variables model the test like from your not necessarily the name, not, but you've done previous testing Yeah, it't very test worked here. Yeah, so see. For example, there's a and your model model production. isated better than the model B or correlated, the model. A for very well, looking at that kind of thing you can. But generally, what happened, the first order features, when you do the interaction t would be less than the feature. And ther interactions will be or less behind. Okay. So normally they don't contribute, but after the second order. But yes, if there are a lot of features that we need to try all. So they will this idea called safety valves. So the simple way of doing is either you build, you know, theursingly, you either include more features, starting with one feature, or you start with a full set of features and aggressively every day. That's not where you. And so, the is I endropic base with it so that you, again compute the entropic difference between the feature intruder and feature, not intruder, right, in the model. And that also we can use it. Then you rank based on the features, right? Which one is a little bit? Then you can select features selection. If that's entropyction. But this is people use what is called shapery values. So it is a concern borrowed from game theory, This meth was invented by a person named Lord Shapey. So what they do is that to think of Michearian b of a cooperative game, drive by all the features to make a prediction. Okay. So then it is a sort of finder, what is a contribution? Okay, so find out the contribution of each feature into your predition, so when it predict their house food, right? Take their a particular record and make an inference in the model, right? So when make an inference, let's say you are you know, predicting this particular transaction as, let's say fraud. Now, in that prediction, each feature adds some contribution. So this method calculate what in the contribution. So based on that contribution can decide some features So for example for this falling kind of a problem. Okay, So, there are four features here. So this is of age and some crimes of attacks. So I don't remember what is this. But you see that, so you can do this at two levels. What is at the global level at the model level? So you want to see where you build a model, which features are important for that model. So that is at level, when you develop a model, you want to do selection. The other is that now you have the model, right? You areition. For example, you are you build a credit scoring model. Okay. And then you did this, you know, this shapery values and you know, identify the best features. Okay. That's very good. Now that model is in production and you are scoring each customer, right, for a lot application, right? Using that. Now, when you make a decision, right, whether the credit is called is higher low, you can look at AJ, shapety values for that particular particular inference, that particular transaction. and decide what whatuted for a loan rejection. So there are two ways of using shape. So to do this, for example, right, what is telling here is that when you build this model and comp the shapety values. So let's say this is a classificated form. Okay. Mayus one. Now, each feature, these are each feature. It is saying the importance, right? So this colour indicates the importance is low or importance is like. So group colour means, you, the importance is low and well colour means the importance is. And here it is minus and plus. So this means that this is available as that. Okay. So it is very high contribution towards minus. Okay. So that is negative class. It is supporting the negative class. Okay. Whereas speech is very very important this word phositive. Similarly, the feature DA is is very low for a negative class, but a little high, not very cry for the positive class. Okay? So it gives this actually the nuumerical value, specificificate using.. Then we can actually sortve this based on value, right? Weve this this feature is based on that value, you see, as that is the highest feature, right? So for this model, ST is the highest feature, and this qu could be madeer, the negative class. Okay, the next feature is RR. That is the positive class like that, okay. So you' probably about to keep only features up this. Okay. So you got, sorry, so this is. Okay, so this is not exactly, okay. So what I'm saying is that. So you saw, okay, so you sought the features based on the safety values, and you can decide to keep each other feature you want to use. So you keep drop towards the sorted based on the shape virus. You can decide it not off. Then any features ever that cut off, you can use it for your modeller. So that is one. Now when you make a simple, let's say, I took this model for morning, I created a custom, for a do that I saw you know, for that particular record, I saw Shap value is that is 4.98 and Shap value is minus 2. So these two features quitude. Over or, let's say rejection of the ration. Then I know what caused the redition of the r. So you can be useful globalance, al for simple predition feature importance. That's what I wanted to say. So, yeah. Yeah, so this is is this here Actually, you should compute, I think I have a. Yeah, this is a lot of notebook, but ready to school tradition. Okay. So this is something not like. So everything is explained at the. How was the shape is there? T school system, and there's some paper, right? you do that.. So you know, he's exactly does that' here. You see, you see the shape you about this coming? Yeah, have you seen? For example, here, right, for credits going. The most important feature is the difference between first par date and first dade B Okay, so that's, you know, what is the thing, right? Your due date, for credit card, then you actually paid that month credit card bill, right? They look at the difference. That's the most important term. So you So that tells you that you should not credit and pay credit climate builds on time. Okay, then then there's some GPS attitude logitude close state versus creation date due day of the week, age. So for each of the spehes, we can go from the spehes. morning days. The shap I will tell you, right, whether it's positive orality how much. So yeah. So what I suggested that all of you, you access to this, you Access the link, then don't work on it, but create a coffee for yours. Okay, create a coffee for yours. So save as coffee for user and just run it moment. Si's free, you can connect to that instant that' running. understand. So this is going to be an exercise for you. Assignment, an I like that earlier in my two assignment, this is easy to do just to run the. Okay, it's. So if you want to understand more shapely values, please run this. Okay. And it will change. Okay. Okay. Not, not Okay. I'm not going to grade. So this is all you understand by this. I product takes 10 minutes. probably half an hour right there. Hello. Yeah, so. So basically, summer Westp cases spl the data by diving plane by access. You do it randomably. If you are all sample your data sample after the scale and operates your data after splitting to data. Use states from the train from the intern data to scale your features like you are box coformation. understanding how your data is done and process domain is possible. Keep of your data linea. it's very important because sometimes you wanted to go back and check, you know, why the model failed, because that you have trained on some backendations, right? So you need to keep track of data version is as important as model version. and use the features that emplo well. We if your features are not used in your model, right, remove them. That's another use to. Because you don't want to, you know, they might get out of distribution that. So Yeah, so visit it. So, yeah. Any questions? Yeah. in the feature selection and you do ECA. PCS type of.. is in media. So if you have more or less nonlinear dependency, then 3C is not So PCA is an not some PCA force are not the kind of insights. So I would think PC decision for a littleachment. So what you can do you can do. course you priority like that.. Okay, I think? No. So we'll take a break and what is time now?
